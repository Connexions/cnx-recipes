<p><em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em> covers the scope and sequence for a one-semester Advance Placement Macroeconomics<sup>&#174;</sup> course. The book is on the example textbook list for the AP<sup>&#174;</sup> course <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/html/apcourseaudit/courses/macroeconomics_textbook_list.html" target="_window">here</a>. The text also includes many current examples, including the housing bubble and housing crisis, Zimbabwe&#8217;s hyperinflation, global unemployment, and the appointment of the United States&#8217; first female Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen.</p>

<p>In order to more closely align to the AP<sup>&#174;</sup> curriculum, this textbook features a more prominent section on the Expenditure-Output model, organized within the section on Keynesian Economics.</p>

<p>The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. The outcome is a balanced approach to economics and to the theory and application of economics concepts. Current events are treated in a politically-balanced way, as well. <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics</em> PDF and web view versions have been updated to include current FRED (Federal Reserve Economic) data.</p>

  <p id="delete_me">Welcome to <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em>, an OpenStax resource. This textbook has been created with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement&#8212;all while encouraging students toward high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a strong foundation in macroeconomics in an accessible format. </p><section data-depth="1" id="eip-809"><h1 data-type="title">About OpenStax</h1><p id="eip-391">
OpenStax is a non-profit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Our free textbooks go through a rigorous editorial publishing process.

<em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em> has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most introductory macroeconomics courses.  At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning.  Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.
</p><section data-depth="2" id="eip-887"><h2 data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</h2><p id="eip-617">
To develop <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em>, we acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor&#8217;s second edition of Principles of Economics and solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to Ph.D.-granting universities.  They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet their and their students&#8217; needs. </p>

<p id="eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. And to make it more applied, we have incorporated many current topics.  We hope students will be interested to know just how far-reaching the recent recession was (and still is). The housing bubble and housing crisis, Zimbabwe&#8217;s hyperinflation, global unemployment, and the appointment of the United States&#8217; first female Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, are just a few of the other important topics covered.</p>

<p id="eip-id1169368893095">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary.  The outcome is a balanced approach to macroeconomics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. New 2015 data are incorporated for topics, such as the average U.S. household consumption in Chapter 2. Current events are treated in a politically-balanced way as well.


</p><p id="eip-734">The book is organized into seven main parts:</p><ul id="eip-679"><li><strong>What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
<li><strong>Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>
<li><strong>Elasticity and Price</strong>, Chapter 5, introduces and explains elasticity and price, two key concepts in economics.</li>
<li><strong>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 6 through 10, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 11 through 13, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The Expenditure/Output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 14 through 18, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>
<li><strong>International Economics</strong>, Chapters 19 through 21, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

Throughout the OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul id="eip-213"><li><strong>Bring It Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#8217;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro module) and the second at chapter&#8217;s end, when students have learned what&#8217;s necessary to understand the case and &#8220;bring home&#8221; the chapter&#8217;s core concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Work It Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li><strong>Clear It Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#8217;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li><strong>Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#8217; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-651"><h2 data-type="title">Questions for Each Level of Learning</h2><p id="eip-454">
The OpenStax version of <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Macroeconomics for AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Courses</em> further expands on Taylor&#8217;s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end-of-module questions for students.
</p><ul id="eip-284"><li><strong>Self-Checks:</strong> Are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#8220;click&#8211;to-reveal&#8221; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think a bit beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li><strong>Review Questions:</strong> Have been retained from Taylor&#8217;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (<u data-effect="underline">not</u> multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li><strong>Critical Thinking Questions:</strong> Are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#8217;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
<li><strong>Problems:</strong> Are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-780"><h2 data-type="title">Updated Art</h2><p id="eip-26">

Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take to class, to the more complex&#8212;&#8220;Should I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my education?&#8221; Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment; information economists call &#8220;imperfect&#8221; because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day. </p><p id="fs-idp9173408">And now, we have another avenue in which to gather information&#8212;social media.

How many of you chose a university without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for information and feedback? </p>
<p id="fs-idp26732128">As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information is disseminated through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. &#8220;Economists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,&#8221; says Jessica Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.</p><p id="fs-idm1264384">This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior in markets &#8212;the world of economics.

<p id="fs-idp82671008"><span data-type="term">Economics</span> is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. <span data-type="term">Scarcity</span> means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the goods they want.   At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available. </p>







<p id="fs-idp23700000">Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158.6 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similarly, the total area of the United States is 3,794,101 square miles. These are large numbers for such crucial resources, however, they are limited. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem. </p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">Scarcity of Resources</div><figcaption>Homeless people are a stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real.

<p id="fs-idp30710144">If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone need food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity. Let&#8217;s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics. </p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp6791984"><h1 data-type="title">The Problem of Scarcity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm5464496">Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. Or if you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it? </p>

    </div><p id="fs-idm92457264">Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn&#8217;t enough money in the budget to do everything.  So why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? The simple answer is most of us do not know how, but that is not the main reason. (When you study economics, you will discover that the obvious choice is not always the right answer&#8212;or at least the complete answer. Studying economics teaches you to think in a different of way.) Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all&#8212;or any&#8212;of those things. It is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is something called <em data-effect="italics">the division and specialization of labor</em>, a production innovation first put forth by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span>, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>. </p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Adam Smith</div><figcaption>Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm47017248"><h1 data-type="title">The Division of and Specialization of Labor</h1>
<p id="fs-idm75995888">The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723&#8211;1790) published his famous book <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em> in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the <span data-type="term">division of labor</span>, which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person. </p>
<p id="fs-idm95830048">To illustrate the division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different people&#8212;all for a pin, believe it or not! </p>
<p id="fs-idm48990176">Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills&#8212;not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm44436912"><h1 data-type="title">Why the Division of Labor Increases Production</h1>
<p id="fs-idm60480400">When the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons. </p>
<p id="fs-idm122368784">First, <span data-type="term">specialization</span> in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">comparative advantage</span>.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, specialization will be affected by geography&#8212;it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not. </p>
<p id="fs-idm51470800">Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. </p>
<p id="fs-idm10733072">A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its &#8220;<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">core competency</span>&#8221;) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. </p><p id="fs-idm62291680">Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of <span data-type="term">economies of scale</span>, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity. </p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp36846976"><h1 data-type="title">Trade and Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm25012544">Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade. </p>
<p id="fs-idp13130160">You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music&#8212;you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket&#8212;you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car&#8212;you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy. </p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp73648"><h1 data-type="title">Why Study Economics?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp132016">Now that we have gotten an overview on what economics studies, let&#8217;s quickly discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to be memorized, though there are plenty of important concepts to be learned. Instead, economics is better thought of as a collection of questions to be answered or puzzles to be worked out. Most important, economics provides the tools to work out those puzzles. If you have yet to be been bitten by the economics &#8220;bug,&#8221; there are other reasons why you should study economics. </p>
<ul id="fs-idm173232">
<li>Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial. </li>
<li>It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the &#8220;fiscal cliff,&#8221; what were the issues involved? Did you know? </li>
<li>A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer&#8217;s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics. </li>
</ul>
<p id="fs-idm217296">The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm47378992" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm77971456">Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker. </p>

<p id="fs-idm15153168">Economics is concerned with the well-being of <em data-effect="italics">all</em> people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers&#8217; skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption. </p>







<p id="fs-idp4626272">It should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground. That ground can be divided into two parts: <span data-type="term">Microeconomics</span> focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; <span data-type="term">Macroeconomics</span> looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy. </p><p id="fs-idm44860752">To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint. </p>







<p id="fs-idp5949552">Whether you are looking at lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live. </p>







<p id="fs-idm59615920">In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy; for example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the performance of the macroeconomy ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions made by individual households and businesses. </p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp49079232"><h1 data-type="title">Microeconomics </h1>
<p id="fs-idm5680000">What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means? </p>
<p id="fs-idp43150560">What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines what prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomic part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior and the theory of the firm. </p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm89833200"><h1 data-type="title">Macroeconomics</h1>
<p id="fs-idp23578512">What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation&#8217;s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay workers off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term? </p>
<p id="fs-idm36646496">An economy's macroeconomic health can be defined by a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals? <span data-type="term">Monetary policy</span>, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets, is conducted by a nation&#8217;s central bank. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. <span data-type="term">Fiscal policy</span>, which involves government spending and taxes, is determined by a nation&#8217;s legislative body. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the main tools the government has to work with. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that will be explored in the macroeconomic chapters of this book. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm58708496" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm180944">Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy. </p>

They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior, that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A <span data-type="term">theory</span> is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other.   The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to be understood, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation being studied. </p>







<p id="fs-idp129892576">Sometimes economists use the term <span data-type="term">model</span> instead of theory.  Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is more applied or empirical representation.  Models are used to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably. </p>







<p id="fs-idp7072">For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product will be, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work. </p>







<p id="fs-idp123790320">A good model to start with in economics is the <span data-type="term">circular flow diagram</span>, which is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups&#8212;households and firms&#8212;that interact in two markets: the <span data-type="term">goods and services market</span> in which firms sell and households buy and the <span data-type="term">labor market</span> in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees. </p>















<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Circular Flow Diagram</div><figcaption>The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm122026608" data-alt="The circular flow diagram&#8217;s outer arrows represent a goods and services market, and the inner arrows represent a labor market. As illustrated by the outer arrows, in a goods and services market, firms give goods and services to households and, in exchange, households give payment to firms. As illustrated by the inner arrows, in a labor market, households provide labor to firms and, in exchange, firms give wages, salaries, and benefits to households.">

As illustrated by the inner arrows, in a labor market, households provide labor to firms and, in exchange, firms give wages, salaries, and benefits to households."></img>
      </span>

    </figure><p id="fs-idp5860544">Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. This is shown in the outer circle, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries and benefits. This is shown in the inner circle and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms demand. </p>







<p id="fs-idp44237760">This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports). </p>







<p id="fs-idp5279008">Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. In economics, theories are expressed as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. Both micro and macroeconomics are explained in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others. </p>

<p id="fs-idp896016">Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for determining the answer. </p>

<p id="fs-idm116325952">Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done? </p>







<p id="fs-idm2603472">There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy. The first is the <span data-type="term">traditional economy</span>, which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops they have always grown using traditional methods. What you produce is what you get to consume. Because things are driven by tradition, there is little economic progress or development. </p>















<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Command Economy</div><figcaption>Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons)</figcaption>
      <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm18599056" data-alt="The image is a photograph of people riding camels in front of two pyramids in Egypt.">

      </span>

    </figure>















<p id="fs-idm22896400">Command economies are very different. In a <span data-type="term">command economy</span>, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord&#8217;s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies. </p>







<p id="fs-idp38251936">In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices will be charged for them. The government decides what methods of production will be used and how much workers will be paid. Many necessities like healthcare and education are provided for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies. </p>















<figure id="CNX_Econ_C01_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Market Economy</div><figcaption>Nothing says &#8220;market&#8221; more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/Flickr Creative Commons)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm54412752" data-alt="The image is a photograph of the New York Stock Exchange&#8217;s entrance">

      </span>

    </figure><p id="fs-idp41834384">Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A <span data-type="term">market</span> is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together. In a <span data-type="term">market economy</span>, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on <span data-type="term">private enterprise</span>: the means of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals. Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, resources and businesses are owned by the government.) What goods and services are supplied depends on what is demanded. A person&#8217;s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person&#8217;s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).  In this scenario, economic decisions are determined by market forces, not governments.  </p>







<p id="fs-idm91198544">Most economies in the real world are mixed; they combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than does the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while they are closer to having a market-oriented system now than several decades ago, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. A rich resource of information about countries and their economies can be found on the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s website, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm78296032" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What countries are considered economically free?</div><p id="fs-idp651728">Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans? Or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the <em data-effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</em> look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.</p>
<p id="fs-idp12476384">The 2015 Heritage Foundation&#8217;s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: some examples of the most free and the least free countries are listed in <a href="#Table_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Several countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Somalia. </p><p id="fs-idm133563488">The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom.

<p id="fs-idp121002496">Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the &#8220;rules of the game&#8221; in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations&#8212;ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated. Heavily regulated economies often have <span data-type="term">underground economies</span>, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government&#8217;s approval. </p>
<p id="fs-idp9942944">The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules. </p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm87109856"><h1 data-type="title">The Rise of Globalization</h1><p id="fs-idm66053168">Recent decades have seen a trend toward <span data-type="term">globalization</span>, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders&#8212;in other words, international trade and financial capital flows. </p>
<p id="fs-idm185091664">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C01_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information&#8212;for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade. </p>
<p id="fs-idm189846048"><a href="#Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013, according to an entity known as The World Bank. <span data-type="term">Exports</span> are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. <span data-type="term">Imports</span> are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically. The size of total production in an economy is measured by the <span data-type="term">gross domestic product (GDP)</span>. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country&#8217;s total economic production is sold in other countries. </p><table id="Table_01_02" summary=" This table has five columns and fifteen rows.

      </tbody></table><p id="fs-idm154635744">In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries. </p>
<p id="fs-idm149456880"><a href="#Table_01_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> also shows that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections. </p><p id="fs-idm6274640">So, hopefully, you now have an idea of what economics is about. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called <a href="/contents/490600d7-8fbc-4b86-a95f-da8a2d4f7e23@3">The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics</a>. It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp835232" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age</div><p id="fs-idm87405776">The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer&#8217;s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested. </p><p id="fs-idm106900864">Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. Facebook post topics range from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.</p><p id="fs-idm62985712">Information helps us make decisions. Decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters should be sent to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If ten reporters are sent to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics! </p>

<p id="fs-idp20173280">In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master's degrees varies from males to females. The average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of $153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor&#8217;s degree: $1,224 weekly and $63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months. In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned if you had stopped your education after high school. A master&#8217;s degree yields a salary almost double that of a high school diploma.</p><p id="fs-idp159623856">Given these statistics, we might expect a lot of people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those choices that give them the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88% of the population in the United States had a high school diploma, only 33.6% of 25&#8211;65 year olds had bachelor&#8217;s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25&#8211;65 year olds in 2014 had earned a master&#8217;s.</p><p id="fs-idp185614208">This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists go about explaining those choices.</p>

<p id="fs-idm63881568">You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.</p>







<p id="fs-idm53392480">In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Always Get What You Want.&#8221; Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898&#8211;1984), in his <em data-effect="italics">Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science</em> in 1932, described not always getting what you want in this way:</p>























<p id="fs-idp187379536"></p><blockquote id="fs-idp57104384">The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.</blockquote>































<p id="fs-idm121643872">Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can society.</p>







<p id="fs-idm117745376">This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how choices <em data-effect="italics">are</em> made or how they <em data-effect="italics">should</em> be made.</p>

<p id="fs-idm3622544">Consider the typical consumer&#8217;s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows Alphonso&#8217;s <span data-type="term">budget constraint</span>, that is, the outer boundary of his <span data-type="term">opportunity set</span>. The opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget. The budget constraint indicates all the combinations of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford when he exhausts his budget, given the prices of the two goods. (There are actually many different kinds of budget constraints. You will learn more about them in the chapter on <a href="/contents/da5c23db-bcb6-468c-9f42-d616f92c6b6d@3" class="target-chapter">Consumer Choices</a>.)</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Budget Constraint: Alphonso&#8217;s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier </div><figcaption>Each point on the budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso&#8217;s budget of $10. The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of burgers and bus tickets. All along the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm18308576" data-alt="The graph shows the budget line as a downward slope representing the opportunity set of burgers and bus tickets.">
<img src="../resources/1c0a0ebfe59cfab6987c214481d16ed5e498d018" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The graph shows the budget line as a downward slope representing the opportunity set of burgers and bus tickets."></img>
</span>

</figure>































<p id="fs-idp125876208">The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.) But if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. This choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers) is shown by point A in the figure. Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. This alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers) is shown by point F.</p>































<p id="fs-idm57338768">If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that connects points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.</p>







<p id="fs-idm16134704">The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that&#8217;s not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? The answer is four bus tickets. That is the true cost to Alphonso of one more burger.</p>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm94573472"><h1 data-type="title">The Concept of Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p id="fs-idm58422240">Economists use the term <span data-type="term">opportunity cost</span> to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else; in short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative&#8212;in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to get other things they desire more.</p>

<p id="fs-idm60005344">A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class (not recommended, by the way), the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.</p>

<p id="fs-idm29379104">Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is &#8722;0.25, indicating that for every four bus tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.</p><p id="fs-idm65887504">There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, the slope is defined as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. So if you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp49096768"><h1 data-type="title">Identifying Opportunity Cost</h1>
<p id="fs-idp54198192">In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price</span>. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300, then $300 measures the amount of &#8220;other consumption&#8221; that he has given up. For practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that could have been bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.</p>
<p id="fs-idp21685264">For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to &#8220;build team spirit.&#8221; The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. But an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51848832">Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.</p>


<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm59463856" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?</div>
<p id="fs-idm119986192">After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed &#8220;sky marshals&#8221; who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.</p>
<p id="fs-idm76729648">But the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), more than 800 million passengers took plane trips in the United States in 2012. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million &#215; 0.5 hours &#215; $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.</p>
</div>



<p id="fs-idm36947072">In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). $5 each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year&#8212;250 days a year &#215; $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If the opportunity cost is described as &#8220;a nice vacation&#8221; instead of &#8220;$5 a day,&#8221; you might make different choices.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm54432448"><h1 data-type="title">Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility</h1>
<p id="fs-idp60642448">The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve <span data-type="term">marginal analysis</span>, which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50547376">People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or <span data-type="term">utility</span> those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on <a href="/contents/da5c23db-bcb6-468c-9f42-d616f92c6b6d@3" class="target-chapter">Consumer Choices</a>, is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility&#8212;perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor&#8217;s appointment. But later bus rides might provide much less utility&#8212;they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the <span data-type="term">law of diminishing marginal utility</span>, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.</p><p id="fs-idm29364672">The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, &#8220;My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.&#8221; Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: &#8220;I enjoy leisure, so I&#8217;ll never work.&#8221; Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm181756608"><h1 data-type="title">Sunk Costs</h1>
<p id="fs-idm91669040">In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that <span data-type="term">sunk costs</span>, which are costs that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.</p>
<p id="fs-idm151708912">Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is feeling kindly, Selena will not get a refund. But staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something&#8212;anything&#8212;else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.</p>
<p id="fs-idm172454896">For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. But the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp138429104"><h1 data-type="title">From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods</h1>
<p id="fs-idm36206528">The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. Or in more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that was presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.</p>
</section>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm131301904" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm25836064">Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people&#8217;s desires exceed what is possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must give up something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of choices available. The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the choices. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.</p>
<p id="fs-idm87796544">Opportunity cost measures cost by what is given up in exchange. Sometimes opportunity cost can be measured in money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that must be given up.</p>
<p id="fs-idm116712832">Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something&#8212;whether it is a specific good or another resource&#8212;the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.</p>

<div data-type="problem" class="problem" id="fs-idm83757952">
<p id="fs-idm45922288">Suppose Alphonso&#8217;s town raised the price of bus tickets to $1 per trip (while the price of burgers stayed at $2 and his budget remained $10 per week.) Draw Alphonso&#8217;s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?</p></div>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm65109504"><p id="fs-idp34096288">The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is flatter than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the horizontal intercept, flattening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.</p>

<p id="fs-idp8409600">Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society, using a model called the <span data-type="term">production possibilities frontier (PPF)</span>. There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.</p>







<p id="fs-idp154544320">Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education.

<p id="fs-idp20648192">In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, healthcare is shown on the vertical axis and education is shown on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. But it would not have any resources to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education shown on the production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. But it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.</p>















<p id="fs-idp154233824">Most important, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up. Just as with Alphonso&#8217;s budget constraint, the opportunity cost is shown by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">slope</span> of the production possibilities frontier. By now you might be saying, &#8220;Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.&#8221; If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>















<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm66189760" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What&#8217;s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?</div>
<p id="fs-idm109827760">There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two goods. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. The second is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available. An additional reason for the lack of numbers is that there is no single way to measure levels of education and healthcare. However, when you think of improvements in education, you can think of accomplishments like more years of school completed, fewer high-school dropouts, and higher scores on standardized tests. When you think of improvements in healthcare, you can think of longer life expectancies, lower levels of infant mortality, and fewer outbreaks of disease.</p><p id="fs-idm22295248">Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. The additional education is measured by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the &#8220;rise&#8221;) over the horizontal distance (the &#8220;run&#8221;). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.</p>
</div>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm97675840"><h1 data-type="title">The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns</h1>
<p id="fs-idm154285040">The budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the slope of the budget constraint was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumption budget constraint</span>. However, the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?</p>
<p id="fs-idm188408336">To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.</p>
<p id="fs-idm69699056">Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting <em data-effect="italics">all</em> spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.</p>
<p id="fs-idm143176752">The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.</p>
<p id="fs-idm95341392">This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name: the <span data-type="term">law of diminishing returns</span>, which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.</p>
<p id="fs-idm122104624">The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp175845152"><h1 data-type="title">Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency</h1>
<p id="fs-idp127138400">The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">cost</span>, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.</p>
<p id="fs-idp98661104">The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.</p>




<figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">Productive and Allocative Efficiency </div><figcaption>Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods being produced&#8212;that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier&#8212;represents the allocation that society most desires.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp112798384" data-alt="The graph shows that when a greater quantity of one good increases, the quantity of other goods will decrease. Point R on the graph represents the good that drops in quantity as a result of greater efficiency in producing other goods.">

Point R on the graph represents the good that drops in quantity as a result of greater efficiency in producing other goods."></img>
</span>

</figure>


<p id="fs-idm11333488"><span data-type="term">Productive efficiency</span> means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm60596048">For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E<sub>2</sub> is greater than E<sub>1</sub>), and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H<sub>2</sub> is great than H<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p id="fs-idm113652816">The particular mix of goods and services being produced&#8212;that is, the specific combination of healthcare and education chosen along the production possibilities frontier&#8212;can be shown as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10582096"><span data-type="term">Allocative efficiency</span> means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp23449568"><h1 data-type="title">Why Society Must Choose</h1>
<p id="fs-idp14240416">Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm64644720">But improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. So, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">firm</span> level, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">market economy</span> coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. But for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="eip-924"><h1 data-type="title">The PPF and Comparative Advantage </h1><p id="eip-796">
While every society must choose how much of each good it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country&#8217;s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology or skills.
</p>
<p id="eip-id1168241961980">Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce a lot of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce a lot of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane.  Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true; the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. This can be illustrated by the PPFs of the two countries in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a></p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_012"><div data-type="title" class="title">Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil </div><figcaption>The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in term of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="eip-id1168231239092" data-alt="This graph shows two images. Both images have y-axes labeled &#8220;Sugar Cane&#8221; and x-axes labeled &#8220;Wheat.&#8221; In image (a), Brazil&#8217;s Sugar Cane production is nearly double the production of its wheat. In image (b), the U.S.&#8217;s Sugar Cane production is nearly half the production of its wheat.">

In image (b), the U.S.&#8217;s Sugar Cane production is nearly half the production of its wheat."></img>
</span>

</figure><p id="eip-971">When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a <span data-type="term">comparative advantage</span> in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane.  The opposite is true for the U.S. If the U.S. moved from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of foregone wheat production.
</p><p id="eip-70">The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on <a href="/contents/1f4933b1-1d91-4e34-a416-0c0d4608f64a@2">International Trade</a> you will learn that countries&#8217; differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods that they have comparative advantage in, and trade part of that production for goods they do not have comparative advantage in. With trade, goods are produced where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties. </p></section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm78431728" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm107669536">A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.</p>
<p id="fs-idp13988016">The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing something, the marginal increase in output will become smaller and smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society&#8217;s resources to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods they have comparative advantage in and trade some of their production for the remaining goods. </p></section>

<p id="fs-idp88727232">It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let&#8217;s consider these arguments in turn.</p>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm27124944"><h1 data-type="title">First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This</h1>
<p id="fs-idm110378752">The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn&#8217;t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10349392">However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions even so. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. But when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm1376720">Someone might argue: &#8220;The scientist&#8217;s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes are actually made.&#8221; This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.</p>
<p id="fs-idm15337952">Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who goes shopping for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. So, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis.  For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on <a href="/contents/da5c23db-bcb6-468c-9f42-d616f92c6b6d@3">Consumer Choices</a>.</p></section>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm6498768"><h1 data-type="title">Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way</h1>
<p id="fs-idp39718608">The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.</p>
<p id="fs-idm100951328">First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between <span data-type="term">positive statements</span>, which describe the world as it is, and <span data-type="term">normative statements</span>, which describe how the world should be. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worth doing&#8212;an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens&#8212;an example of normative analysis.</p>
<p id="fs-idp39743760">Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span>, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book, <em data-effect="italics">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, puts it very clearly: &#8220;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.&#8221; Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.</p>
<p id="fs-idp4775504">Second, self-interested behavior and profit-seeking can be labeled with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend a lot of money on themselves. Others may earn a lot of money and give it to charity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require a great deal of time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that does not take lots of their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business. People&#8217;s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.</p>



<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm90076880" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is a diagram by any other name the same?</div>
<p id="fs-idm23901664">When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams: diagrams in the text, diagrams in the lectures, diagrams in the problems, and diagrams on exams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each of the individual diagrams.</p>
<p id="fs-idm59650928">This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although it is presented with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C02_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm37958336">The first theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">scarcity</span>. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains&#8212;just at a different level. The second theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">tradeoffs</span>. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint, the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers are represented by a curved line because the law of diminishing returns holds that as resources are added to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.</p>
<p id="fs-idm42608432">The third theme is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">economic efficiency</span>, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual&#8217;s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm35091920">The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, labor supply versus leisure, saving versus consumption, environmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not be confused by the different labels. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C02_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Tradeoff Diagram </div><figcaption>Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp73277088" data-alt="Two graphs will occur frequently throughout the text. They represent the possible outcomes of constraints/production of goods. The graph on the left has &#8220;Good 2&#8221; along the y-axis and &#8220;Good 1&#8221; along the x-axis. The graph on the right has &#8220;Good 1&#8221; along the y-axis and &#8220;Good 2&#8221; along the x-axis.">

</span>

</div>



<p id="fs-idp47826144">Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in <em data-effect="italics">The Wealth of Nations</em>, christened this property the <span data-type="term">invisible hand</span>. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:</p>
<p id="fs-idp96677296"></p><blockquote id="fs-idp130687056">Every individual&#8230;generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention&#8230;By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.</blockquote><p id="fs-idm2780352">The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish individual actions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp17061536">Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. But then you might turn around and focus on other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.</p>


<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm3333744" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Choices ... To What Degree?</div>
<p id="fs-idm103153136">What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. So, an economist might argue that people do not go on to get bachelor&#8217;s degrees or master&#8217;s degrees because they do not have the resources to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor&#8217;s degree or a master&#8217;s degree may not be available in their opportunity set.</p>
<p id="fs-idm97709104">The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor&#8217;s degree or a master&#8217;s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of giving up years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1767648">Finally, the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">intertemporal choices</span>. An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than putting that consumption off until after they graduate college.</p>

<p id="fs-idm151027680">The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists make the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.</p>

<p id="fs-idp37204704">Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but worldwide. At one time, consumers had to go to specialty stores or farmer&#8217;s markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores. In short, organic is part of the mainstream.</p>
<p id="fs-idp18674976">Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost $1.99 a pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.49 a pound? The same price relationship is true for just about every organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take less time to get to market and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those forces have a lot to do with this chapter&#8217;s topic: demand and supply.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idp85391488">When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical understanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.71 per gallon in June 2014? Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $2.07 per gallon by January 2015? To explain these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and what gasoline sellers are willing to accept.</p><p id="fs-idm10696864">As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January of that same year; over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing to pay more for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during those six months, such as increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.</p><p id="fs-idm18670544">This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply&#8212;one of the most powerful models in all of economics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the quantity sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in prices and quantities.</p>

<p id="fs-idm43689872">First let&#8217;s first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand and supply interact in a market.</p>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp164241728"><h1 data-type="title">Demand for Goods and Services</h1>
<p id="fs-idp145515472">Economists use the term <span data-type="term">demand</span> to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price. Demand is based on needs and wants&#8212;a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist&#8217;s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand.</p>
<p id="fs-idp162371840">What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called <span data-type="term">price</span>. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the <span data-type="term">quantity demanded</span>. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the <span data-type="term">law of demand</span>. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.</p>
<p id="fs-idp125928160">An example from the market for gasoline can be shown in the form of a table or a graph. A table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as <a href="#Table_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is called a <span data-type="term">demand schedule</span>. Price in this case is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline. The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A <span data-type="term">demand curve</span> shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)</p>
<p id="fs-idp72633840">The demand schedule shown by <a href="#Table_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and the demand curve shown by the graph in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are two ways of describing the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.</p>


<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Demand Curve for Gasoline </div><figcaption>The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. These points are then graphed, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D).

<p id="fs-idp92211968">Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left to right. So demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.</p>
<p id="fs-idm13923584">Confused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm9151600" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is demand the same as quantity demanded?</div>
<p id="fs-idp18974320">In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm37573200"><h1 data-type="title">Supply of Goods and Services</h1>
<p id="fs-idp102318432">When economists talk about <span data-type="term">supply</span>, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">good</span> or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">service</span>. A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the <span data-type="term">quantity supplied</span> of that good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied&#8212;that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied&#8212;the <span data-type="term">law of supply</span>. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.</p>
<p id="fs-idp26677568">Still unsure about the different types of supply? See the following Clear It Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp68971696" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is supply the same as quantity supplied?</div>

Like demand, supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph. A <span data-type="term">supply schedule</span> is a table, like <a href="#Table_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons. A <span data-type="term">supply curve</span> is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis.

<p id="fs-idp19386416">The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm393056"><h1 data-type="title">Equilibrium&#8212;Where Demand and Supply Intersect</h1>
<p id="fs-idm110531152">Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market.</p>

<p id="fs-idp5911872">Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is called the <span data-type="term">equilibrium</span>. The <span data-type="term">equilibrium price</span> is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree&#8212;that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). This common quantity is called the <span data-type="term">equilibrium quantity</span>. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.</p>
<p id="fs-idp49221616">In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.</p>
<p id="fs-idm121129440">The word &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; means &#8220;balance.&#8221; If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to move the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.</p>
<p id="fs-idm170650816">Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price&#8212;that is, instead of $1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. This above-equilibrium price is illustrated by the dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500. This decline in quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.</p>
<p id="fs-idp418176">Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the higher price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this an <span data-type="term">excess supply</span> or a <span data-type="term">surplus</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm95010144">With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making and selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. So, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.</p>
<p id="fs-idm100059504">Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at this price in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline producers&#8217; incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550.</p>
<p id="fs-idm91120096">When the price is below equilibrium, there is <span data-type="term">excess demand</span>, or a <span data-type="term">shortage</span>&#8212;that is, at the given price the quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level.  Read <a href="/contents/10b6fd2f-dd19-4a31-9e85-d7d517f6c21b@5">Demand, Supply, and Efficiency</a> for more discussion on the importance of the demand and supply model.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idp57667456">A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand curve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of demand states that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.</p>
<p id="fs-idm94846624">A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve shows the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher price typically leads to a higher quantity supplied.</p>
<p id="fs-idm70608144">The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. Excess supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward the equilibrium level. </p></section>

      <p id="fs-idp33598752">Review <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Suppose the price of gasoline is $1.60 per gallon. Is the quantity demanded higher or lower than at the equilibrium price of $1.40 per gallon? And what about the quantity supplied? Is there a shortage or a surplus in the market? If so, of how much?</p>
</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm9260672"><p id="fs-idp57350896">Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550 gallons and the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of demand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the gasoline market of 640 &#8211; 550 = 90 gallons.</p></div>

  <p id="fs-idp116321616">The previous module explored how <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price</span> affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only thing that influences demand. Nor is it the only thing that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more consumers to avoid eating meat? Or how is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover several new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or supply?</p>

</div><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp17963200"><h1 data-type="title">What Factors Affect Demand?</h1>
<p id="fs-idm42705312">We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.</p>
<p id="fs-idm71852384">These factors matter both for demand by an individual and demand by the market as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> assumption.</p>
</section>















































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm104305088"><h1 data-type="title">The <em data-effect="italics">Ceteris Paribus</em> Assumption</h1>
<p id="fs-idm144923824">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand curve</span> or a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">supply curve</span> is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors, other than the product&#8217;s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption <span data-type="term">ceteris paribus</span>, a Latin phrase meaning &#8220;other things being equal.&#8221; Any given demand or supply curve is based on the <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm163434208" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">When does <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> apply?</div>
<p id="fs-idm201392240"><em data-effect="italics">Ceteris paribus</em> is typically applied when we look at how changes in price affect demand or supply, but <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> can be applied more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For example, a consumer&#8217;s demand depends on income and a producer&#8217;s supply depends on the cost of producing the product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time&#8212;say price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors are held constant.</p>
<p id="fs-idm113255424">For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> assumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second because of the lower income.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm90417728"><h1 data-type="title">How Does Income Affect Demand?</h1>
<p id="fs-idm128474976">Let&#8217;s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the initial demand for automobiles as D<sub>0</sub>. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18 million. D<sub>0</sub> also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17 million, at point R.</p><p id="fs-idm88788912">The original demand curve D<sub>0</sub>, like every demand curve, is based on the <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> assumption that no other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this graphically?</p>
<p id="fs-idm103204992">Return to <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve shifts to the right to the new demand curve D<sub>1</sub>, indicating an increase in demand. <a href="#Table_03_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.</p>



<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">Shifts in Demand: A Car Example </div><figcaption>Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.

<p id="fs-idm39559696">Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D<sub>0</sub> would shift left to D<sub>2</sub>. The shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>2</sub> represents such a decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.</p>
<p id="fs-idm64335872">When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures an pattern for the market as a whole.</p>
<p id="fs-idm36684448">In the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for most goods and services. For some&#8212;luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry&#8212;the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is called a <span data-type="term">normal good</span>. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home, and so on. A product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an <span data-type="term">inferior good</span>. In other words, when income increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm29397760"><h1 data-type="title">Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves</h1>
<p id="fs-idm85170144">Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other things that change demand include tastes and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let&#8217;s look at these factors.</p>



<p id="fs-idm115517696"><strong data-effect="bold">Changing Tastes or Preferences</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm141552672">From 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.</p><p id="fs-idm52526912"><strong data-effect="bold">Changes in the Composition of the Population </strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm48776928">The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Census Bureau</span>) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.</p>
<p id="fs-idm107091696">The demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements. A <span data-type="term">substitute</span> is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service. As electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which can be shown graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3135008">Other goods are <span data-type="term">complements</span> for each other, meaning that the goods are often used together, because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.</p>





<p id="fs-idm83231456"><strong data-effect="bold">Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm141098960">While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a <span data-type="term">shift in demand</span> happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.</p>




<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm42358192" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Shift in Demand</div>
<p id="fs-idm22122272">A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.</p>
<p id="fs-idm115694720">Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P<sub>0</sub>). Identify the corresponding Q<sub>0</sub>. An example is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_019" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_019"><div data-type="title" class="title">Demand Curve </div><figcaption>The demand curve can be used to identify how much consumers would buy at any given price.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm94402672" data-alt="The graph represents the directions for step 1.A demand curve shows how much consumers would be willing to buy at any given price.">

</span>
</figure>

<p id="fs-idm23986688">Step 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to the new point with the new Q<sub>1</sub>. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q<sub>1</sub>. An example is provided in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_020" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>


<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_020"><div data-type="title" class="title">Demand Curve with Income Increase </div><figcaption>With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm4475184" data-alt="The graph represents the directions for step 2. With an increased income, consumers will wish to buy a higher quantity (Q sub 1) than they bought with a lower income.">

</span>
</figure>

<p id="fs-idp75089808">Step 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_021" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp7448176"><h1 data-type="title">Summing Up Factors That Change Demand</h1>

<p id="fs-idm99811792">Six factors that can shift demand curves are summarized in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.</p>

<p id="fs-idm178358384">When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.</p>
</section>















































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm65744640"><h1 data-type="title">How Production Costs Affect Supply</h1>
<p id="fs-idm29526400">A supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> so that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the entire supply curve will shift. Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a <span data-type="term">shift in supply</span> means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.</p>
<p id="fs-idm43531936">In thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the difference between revenues and costs. Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or what we call <span data-type="term">inputs</span> or <span data-type="term">factors of production</span>. If a firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm&#8217;s profits go up. When a firm&#8217;s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn. So, when costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price for its output. This can be shown by the supply curve shifting to the right.</p>
<p id="fs-idp59319552">Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.</p>
<p id="fs-idm15129456">Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.</p>
<p id="fs-idm25878112">Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S<sub>0</sub> in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus,</em> the quantity supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S<sub>0</sub> curve shows. The same information can be shown in table form, as in <a href="#Table_03_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>


<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">Shifts in Supply: A Car Example </div><figcaption>Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.

<p id="fs-idm143891376">Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a lower quantity. This can be shown graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, which indicates that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S<sub>1</sub>, which is labeled as point L.</p>
<p id="fs-idm107781904">Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S<sub>2</sub>, which is labeled M.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp74095824"><h1 data-type="title">Other Factors That Affect Supply</h1>
<p id="fs-idm23435184">In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.</p>
<p id="fs-idp111327232">The cost of production for many agricultural products will be affected by changes in natural conditions. For example, in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied; conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right.</p><p id="fs-idm62101232">When a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">firm</span> discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world was grown with these Green Revolution seeds&#8212;and the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.</p>
<p id="fs-idp84369536">Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Taxes are treated as costs by businesses. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons discussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace; complying with regulations increases costs.</p>
<p id="fs-idm27650224">A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the firm&#8217;s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm&#8217;s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how this shift happens.</p>


<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp9921616" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Shift in Supply</div>
<p id="fs-idp84368976">We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.</p>
<p id="fs-idp169557072">Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q<sub>0</sub>). If you draw a vertical line up from Q<sub>0</sub> to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. An example is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>


<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_022"><div data-type="title" class="title">Suppy Curve </div><figcaption>The supply curve can be used to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp37229232" data-alt="The graph represents the directions for step 1. A supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept (P sub 0) to supply a given quantity of output (Q sub 0).">

</span>
</figure>





<p id="fs-idm49126288">Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts. The first part is the average cost of production, in this case, the cost of the pizza ingredients (dough, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and so on), the cost of the pizza oven, the rent on the shop, and the wages of the workers. The second part is the firm&#8217;s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm&#8217;s supply curve, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>



<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_023"><div data-type="title" class="title">Setting Prices </div><figcaption>The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp61490608" data-alt="The graph represents the directions for step 2. For a given quantity of output (Q sub 0), the firm wishes to charge a price (P sub 0) equal to the cost of production plus the desired profit margin.">
<img src="../resources/a379c135419a9d70d1bf401e706325fad2f44b0b" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The graph represents the directions for step 2. For a given quantity of output (Q sub 0), the firm wishes to charge a price (P sub 0) equal to the cost of production plus the desired profit margin."></img>
</span>
</figure>



<p id="fs-idm50030960">Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production goes up. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by $0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_024"><div data-type="title" class="title">Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing Price </div><figcaption>Because the cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also need to increase.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm108114800" data-alt="The graph represents the directions for step 3. An increase in production cost will raise the price a firm wishes to charge (to P sub 1) for a given quantity of output (Q sub 0).">

</span>
</figure>

<p id="fs-idp74824768">Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_025"><div data-type="title" class="title">Supply Curve Shifts </div><figcaption>When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a new price level.</figcaption>

Notice that a change in the price of the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve.

</figure><p id="fs-idm3871744">Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really &#8220;umbrella&#8221; concepts: demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. Factors other than price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of economic circumstances.</p>

<p id="fs-idp3165600">Let&#8217;s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.</p>







<p id="fs-idm52395200">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.</p>







<p id="fs-idp55222320">Step 2. Decide whether the economic change being analyzed affects demand or supply. In other words, does the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?</p>







<p id="fs-idp24321312">Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?</p>







<p id="fs-idm53526400">Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and quantity.</p>







<p id="fs-idp48158496">Let&#8217;s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example where both supply and demand shift.</p>







































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm95664464"><h1 data-type="title">Good Weather for Salmon Fishing</h1>
<p id="fs-idm96936176">In the summer of 2000, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the four-step approach, which is explained below, to work through this problem. <a href="#Table_03_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides the information to work the problem as well.</p>

<p id="fs-idm33623968">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks; what consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)</p><p id="fs-idm60200416">Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.</p>
<p id="fs-idp54862544">Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to the new supply curve S<sub>1</sub>, which is shown in both the table and the figure.</p><p id="fs-idm55833264">Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub>, the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to 550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve did not move.</p><p id="fs-idm29543312">In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm22656960"><h1 data-type="title">Newspapers and the Internet</h1>
<p id="fs-idp108309040">According to the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pew Research Center for People and the Press</span>, more and more people, especially younger people, are getting their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to get the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported getting their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.</p>



<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Print News Market: A Four-Step Analysis </div><figcaption>A change in tastes from print news sources to digital sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former.

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm7452320">Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships. In this case, the analysis is performed without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.</p><p id="fs-idm103615536">Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.</p>
<p id="fs-idm63975312">Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm25008960">Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p id="fs-idp13978336">The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they got their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades, with the share of Americans getting their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not get their news from television at all?</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm18058720"><h1 data-type="title">The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm116209728">In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.</p>
<p id="fs-idm172967584">Moreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em></span> assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.</p></section>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm113280976"><h1 data-type="title">A Combined Example</h1>
<p id="fs-idm42433440">The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, more and more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_029" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_029"><div data-type="title" class="title">Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis </div><figcaption>(a) Higher labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price.

<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm73597216" data-alt="This image has two panels. The one on the left shows the four step analysis of higher compensation for postal workers. The one on the right shows the four-step analysis of a change in tastes away from Postal Services.">

</figure>



<p id="fs-idm137013200">Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from &#8220;snailmail&#8221; to email and other digital messages.</p>
<p id="fs-idm97110416"> <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_029" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.</p>
<p id="fs-idm116915856">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships.</p>
<p id="fs-idp2072240">Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.</p>
<p id="fs-idm46298080">Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.
</p><p id="fs-idm108001552">Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p id="fs-idm109410240"> <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_029" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows the shift in demand discussed in the following steps.</p>
<p id="fs-idm168055520">Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships. Note that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).</p><p id="fs-idm133417648">Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.</p>
<p id="fs-idm138088448">Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="fs-idm46703552">Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p id="fs-idm96669440">The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_030" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm21376496">Following are the results:</p>
<p id="fs-idm31866688">Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snailmail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q<sub>3</sub>). This is easy to see graphically, since Q<sub>3</sub> is to the left of Q<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm130423904">Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snailmail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.</p><p id="fs-idm130104928">The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp22029344" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or supply curve?</div>
<p id="fs-idm12550704">One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an introductory economics class, might reason:</p>
<p id="fs-idp41575248"> &#8220;Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> shown on the diagram (called Shift 1). So the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">equilibrium quantity</span> is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shown by the shift from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>, on the diagram (shown as Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now moves from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>3</sub>.&#8221;</p>

<p id="fs-idm182884000">At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee&#8217;s logic, and then read the answer that follows.</p>
<p id="fs-idm146235232"><em data-effect="italics">Answer:</em> Lee&#8217;s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>), from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>. The rest of Lee&#8217;s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.</p>
<p id="fs-idm194383488">Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.</p>
</div>


<p id="fs-idm162362848">In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Indeed, even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, prices are often then pushed by another change in demand or supply toward another equilibrium.</p>

<p id="fs-idm27220992">When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price and quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the market looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.</p>

<p id="fs-idp136507776">Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for products that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing &#8220;too high&#8221; or falling &#8220;too low.&#8221;</p>







<p id="fs-idp110365776">The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives provided by these laws to control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.</p>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp127569408"><h1 data-type="title">Price Ceilings</h1>
<p id="fs-idp59457008">Laws that government enacts to regulate prices are called <span data-type="term">Price controls</span>. Price controls come in two flavors. A <span data-type="term">price ceiling</span> keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the &#8220;ceiling&#8221;), while a <span data-type="term">price floor</span> keeps a price from falling below a certain level (the &#8220;floor&#8221;). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.</p>
<p id="fs-idp10145024">In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by stating that rents can be raised by only a certain maximum percentage each year.</p><p id="fs-idp53410992">Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Changes of this sort can cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) lies at the intersection of supply curve S<sub>0</sub> and demand curve D<sub>0</sub>, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as shown by the data in <a href="#Table_03_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and the shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub>, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_012"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Price Ceiling Example&#8212;Rent Control </div><figcaption>The original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E<sub>0</sub>. If demand shifts from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, the new equilibrium would be at E<sub>1</sub>&#8212;unless a price ceiling prevents the price from rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp2580864">Suppose that a rent control law is passed to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500 for a typical apartment. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there. At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).</p>
<p id="fs-idm43741968">Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing&#8212;everything has an opportunity cost. So if renters get &#8220;cheaper&#8221; housing than the market requires, they tend to also end up with lower quality housing.</p>
<p id="fs-idm61612032">Price ceilings have been proposed for other products. For example, price ceilings to limit what producers can charge have been proposed in recent years for prescription drugs, doctor and hospital fees, the charges made by some automatic teller bank machines, and auto insurance rates. Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who demand the product. But when the market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp60176432"><h1 data-type="title">Price Floors</h1>
<p id="fs-idm68862976">A price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in markets for goods and services, labor, or financial capital. Perhaps the best-known example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the normative view that someone working full time ought to be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage at the end of 2014 was $7.25 per hour, which yields an income for a single person slightly higher than the poverty line. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage.</p><p id="fs-idp51408048">Price floors are sometimes called &#8220;price supports,&#8221; because they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. So even if, on average, farm incomes are adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.</p>


<p id="fs-idp76493296">The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product, adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">European Union (EU)</span> will spend about 60 billion euros per year, or 67 billion dollars per year, or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for Europe&#8217;s farmers from 2014 to 2020.</p><p id="fs-idm54900352"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub>, with price P<sub>0</sub> and quantity Q<sub>0</sub>. However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market equilibrium level&#8212;the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, a surplus exists.</p>


<p id="fs-idm17410896">The high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, are estimated to spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Numerous proposals have been offered for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. Either because this is viewed by the population as supporting the traditional rural way of life or because of the lobbying power of the agro-business industry.</p>

There is excess supply, also called a surplus.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm47624992">Neither price ceilings nor price floors cause demand or supply to change. They simply set a price that limits what can be legally charged in the market. Remember, changes in price do not cause demand or supply to change. Price ceilings and price floors can cause a different choice of quantity demanded along a demand curve, but they do not move the demand curve. Price controls can cause a different choice of quantity supplied along a supply curve, but they do not shift the supply curve.</p></div>

  <p id="fs-idm36936576">The familiar <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand and supply diagram</span> holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. To economists, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">efficiency</span> means it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.</p><p id="fs-idp55878896">Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and service is being produced and consumed.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp93089408"><h1 data-type="title">Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus</h1>
<p id="fs-idp71381248">Consider a market for tablet computers, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">equilibrium</span> point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.</p>
<p id="fs-idp97392880">For example, point J shows that if the price was $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay for. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers&#8217; willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumer surplus</span>. Consumer surplus is the area labeled F&#8212;that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_015"><div data-type="title" class="title">Consumer and Producer Surplus </div><figcaption>The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm49259952" data-alt="The graph shows consumer surplus above the equilibrium and producer surplus beneath the equilibrium.">

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp95320208">The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller&#8217;s actual cost is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">producer surplus</span>. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, producer surplus is the area labeled G&#8212;that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.</p>
<p id="fs-idm16695504">The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">social surplus</span>, also referred to as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">economic surplus</span>. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, social surplus would be shown as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp1777824"><h1 data-type="title">Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings</h1>
<p id="fs-idm102790816">The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. But there is an additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm64328720">Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_028" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.</p>
<p id="fs-idp16468080">As a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">deadweight loss</span>. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_028" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case because the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price control</span> is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make.</p>
<p id="fs-idp29791504">A second change from the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price ceiling</span> is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C03_028"><div data-type="title" class="title">Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings </div><figcaption>(a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm53199312" data-alt="The two graphs show how equilibrium is affected by price floors and price ceilings.">
      <img src="../resources/b1ca9b7b41383f03fb340872066b9f66642a8204" data-media-type="image/jpeg" alt="The two graphs show how equilibrium is affected by price floors and price ceilings."></img>
    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm52646480"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C03_028" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price floor</span> causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.</p>
<p id="fs-idm3338320">This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to consumers&#8212;which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy&#8217;s social surplus.</p>

<p id="fs-idm35460896">Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences, and the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity.</p></section>

    </div>
   </div><p id="eip-379"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be above equilibrium, which means that Qd will be less than Qs. Firms can only sell what is demanded, so the number of transactions will fall to Qd. This is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be below the equilibrium price, so Qd will be greater than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is less.</p><div data-type="exercise" class="exercise" id="fs-idm134359888"><div data-type="problem" class="problem" id="fs-idm177565472">

    </div></div><p id="eip-82"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative.

As this population grows older, they will be faced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer&#8217;s that may require hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-extending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, which expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, will further increase the demand.</p><p id="fs-idp8561008">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are expected to increase by 19% between 2012 and 2022. The median annual wage of $67,930 (in 2012) is also expected to increase. The BLS forecasts that 526,000 new nurses will be needed by 2022. One concern is the low rate of enrollment in nursing programs to help meet the growing demand. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), enrollment in 2011 increased by only 5.1% due to a shortage of nursing educators and teaching facilities.</p><p id="fs-idm103677984">These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will face several challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze in the second half of this case at chapter&#8217;s end what might happen in the labor market for nursing and other healthcare professionals. </p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp60268464" class="note economics chapter-objectives"><div data-type="title" class="title">Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets</div><p id="fs-idm14702256">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm26607056">
<li>Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets</li>
<li>Demand and Supply in Financial Markets</li>
<li>The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information</li>
</ul>
</div>







<p id="fs-idm78936752">The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even markets for financial services like labor and financial investments. Labor markets are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.</p>







<p id="fs-idm71032384">When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture who the demanders and suppliers are: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of money, and any who borrows (person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand for money.</p>







<p id="fs-idm106632064">As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for most college students: In 2011, says the BLS, 52% of undergraduates worked part time and another 20% worked full time. Most college students are also heavily involved in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. Among full-time students, about half take out a loan to help finance their education each year, and those loans average about $6,000 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the goods markets.</p>

 <p id="fs-idm189945040">Markets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods.

The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp49116848"><h1 data-type="title">Equilibrium in the Labor Market</h1>
<p id="fs-idp12390096">In 2013, about 34,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors&#8217; offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes.
<a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates how demand and supply determine equilibrium in this labor market.

The equilibrium salary is $70,000 and the equilibrium quantity is 34,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied increases to 38,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 33,000. At this above-equilibrium salary, an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $60,000, quantity supplied declines to 27,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 40,000 nurses.

</tbody></table><p id="fs-idp25794320">The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example, labor is measured by number of workers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The vertical axis shows the price for nurses&#8217; labor&#8212;that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this &#8220;price&#8221; would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as high as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example, the price of labor is measured by salary on an annual basis, although in other cases the price of labor could be measured by monthly or weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and nursing homes may cut back on the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses&#8217; salaries may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.</p>
<p id="fs-idp149126320">As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses&#8217; salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area.</p><p id="fs-idm47435008">At <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">equilibrium</span>, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is $70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by focusing on the &#8220;average&#8221; nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses is actually made up of many smaller markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that differ in quality; for instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the submarkets.</p><p id="fs-idp107806128">When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at $75,000 per year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess supply in the <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">labor market</span>, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses&#8217; salary will move down toward equilibrium.</p><p id="fs-idp120019456">In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idm9497664">The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate, under the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em></span> assumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.</p><p id="fs-idp101095040">Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand for the good or service that is being produced. For example, the more new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a &#8220;derived demand.&#8221; Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:</p>
<ul id="fs-idp143298608">
<li>The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.</li>
<li>The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.</li>
<li>The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.</li>
</ul>
<p id="fs-idp132595664">As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers&#8217; production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. <a href="#Table_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.</p>

<table id="Table_04_02" summary="This table has two columns and six rows. The columns are labeled 'Factors' and 'Results.' Under the 'Factors' column are the following phrases, 'Demand for Output,' 'Education and Training,' 'Technology,' 'Number of Companies,' 'Government Regulations,' and 'Price and Availability of Other Inputs.' Under the 'Results' column are the following explanations: 'When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production,' 'Well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by employers.

<p id="fs-idp49629200">The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the quantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff between supplying labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The higher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. <a href="#Table_04_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists some of the factors that will cause the supply to increase or decrease.</p>

<p id="fs-idp2080224">A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift those curves. However, other events like those outlined here will cause either the demand or the supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm35414864"><h1 data-type="title">Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process</h1>
<p id="fs-idm53282000">Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by being able to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. So, how will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in <a href="/contents/109e65a0-11d0-47a2-84f4-e57c9ea88fa5@2">Demand and Supply</a>) works in this way:</p><p id="fs-idm29441920">Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new technologies? In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), S<sub>0</sub> is the original supply curve for labor and D<sub>0</sub> is the original demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E<sub>0</sub>, occurs at the price W<sub>0</sub> and the quantity Q<sub>0</sub>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply </div><figcaption>(a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp37946784" data-alt="The two graphs show how new technology influences supply and demand. The graph on the left represents low-skill labor, and the graph on the right represents high-skill labor.">
<img src="../resources/9ab76f6626367880e8223a824826f5f1716860cc" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The two graphs show how new technology influences supply and demand. The graph on the left represents low-skill labor, and the graph on the right represents high-skill labor."></img>
</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp71794016">Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm12906624">Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="fs-idp68241088">Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E<sub>1</sub> with price W<sub>1</sub> and quantity Q<sub>1</sub>, has a lower wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E<sub>0</sub>. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as point E<sub>1</sub> with price W<sub>1</sub> and quantity Q<sub>1</sub>, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp46147136">So, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. Indeed, from the 1970s to the mid-2000s, the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with comparable job experience, but by 2012, a college graduate earned about 60% more than an otherwise comparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy was primarily caused by the new technologies.</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm46604752"><h1 data-type="title">Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages</h1>
<p id="fs-idm186043152">In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: sometimes limits are proposed on the high incomes of top business executives.</p>
<p id="fs-idp50477280">The labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a <span data-type="term">minimum wage</span>, a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage, which they call a <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">living wage</span>. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is $14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. So the family income would be $14,500, which is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $23,850 in 2014.)</p><p id="fs-idm73713216">Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that are hired by the city be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.</p>

<p id="fs-idp23055712"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved. <a href="#Table_04_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the differences in supply and demand at different wages.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor </div><figcaption>The original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/hour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm141282944"><h1 data-type="title">The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor</h1>
<p id="fs-idm277627248">The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly below it. About 1% of American workers are actually paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor. But for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently below the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.</p>

<p id="fs-idm111510336">Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places&#8212;although these studies are controversial.</p>

<p id="fs-idp2474192">Let&#8217;s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly <em data-effect="italics">below</em>  the equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage is said to be <em data-effect="italics">nonbinding</em> &#8212;that is, the price floor is not determining the market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity of employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the minimum wage is increased by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.</p>

<p id="fs-idp87674912">These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the minimum wage were increased dramatically&#8212;say, if it were doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have considered&#8212;then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp168944640" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What&#8217;s the harm in raising the minimum wage?</div>
<p id="fs-idp69265536">Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let&#8217;s say for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.</p>
<p id="fs-idp62197152">If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.</p>

<p id="fs-idm26461216">Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want people to work. Overall, this worker&#8217;s income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1547680">Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The <a href="/contents/99014a4d-b0b1-4b61-ae99-c7cce72bf853@2" class="target-chapter">Poverty and Economic Inequality</a> chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm3091936">In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the market for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of financial capital when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they borrow or receive financial investments.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10467104">In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, the price can be measured by the annual salary or hourly wage received. The quantity of labor can be measured in various ways, like number of workers or the number of hours worked.</p>
<p id="fs-idp110854192">Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product that the labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in government policy that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to: workers&#8217; level of education and training, technology, the number of companies, and availability and price of other inputs.</p>
<p id="fs-idp95002240">The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative to the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for the job, the number of workers in the economy, and required education.</p>

 <p id="fs-idm30800048">United States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved almost $1.9 trillion in 2013. Where did that savings go and what was it used for? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.</p><p id="fs-idm26604064">In this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">financial capital</span> (i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the <a href="/contents/de7f5785-c957-444b-839c-9082d9670a39@2">Financial Markets</a> chapter.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm46984928"><h1 data-type="title">Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp114092128">In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms, depending on the type of investment.</p><p id="fs-idm1648096">The simplest example of a rate of return is the <span data-type="term">interest rate</span>. For example, when you supply money into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest paid to you as a percent of your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the money you borrow.</p>
<p id="fs-idp5031840">Let&#8217;s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2014, almost 200 million Americans were cardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the borrowed amount plus interest, though most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying interest. A typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In 2014, Americans had about $793 billion outstanding in credit card debts. About half of U.S. families with credit cards report that they almost always pay the full balance on time, but one-quarter of U.S. families with credit cards say that they &#8220;hardly ever&#8221; pay off the card in full. In fact, in 2014, 56% of consumers carried an unpaid balance in the last 12 months. Let&#8217;s say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per year. So, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in interest on their credit cards&#8212;plus basic fees for the credit card or fees for late payments.</p><p id="fs-idm22241008"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the financial market shows the quantity of money that is loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis shows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing can be measured with an interest rate. <a href="#Table_04_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity that credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards </div><figcaption>In this market for credit card borrowing, the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at equilibrium &#8364;.

The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion.

<p id="fs-idm74419648">The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to the <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">law of demand</span>, a higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises, consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will fall.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp21425296"><h1 data-type="title">Equilibrium in Financial Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm126294720">In the financial market for credit cards shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds demanded and the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.</p><p id="fs-idm84691024">If the interest rate (remember, this measures the &#8220;price&#8221; in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to $480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the equilibrium level.</p>
<p id="fs-idp21777648">If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion; but the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp14067728"><h1 data-type="title">Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm8453296">Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their savings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.</p>
<p id="fs-idp132736880">Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists call this <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">intertemporal decision making</span> because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store, decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time, sometimes a long period.</p>
<p id="fs-idp27477344">Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once they retire. So they save today and supply financial markets. If their income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the left.</p>
<p id="fs-idp8885344">By contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. So when consumers and businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.</p>
<p id="fs-idp141290128">For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that investments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted to the right. Conversely, during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, their demand for financial capital at any given interest rate shifted to the left.</p>
<p id="fs-idp156601536">To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types of financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers will shift their funds to Investment B&#8212;and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.</p>

<p id="fs-idm123889072">In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with one of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm608" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt</div><p id="fs-idm13381760">Imagine that the U.S. economy became viewed as a less desirable place for foreign investors to put their money because of fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?</p>
<p id="fs-idm41405712">Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> occurs at interest rate R<sub>0</sub> and quantity of financial investment Q<sub>0</sub>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty </div><figcaption>The graph shows the demand for financial capital from and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R<sub>0</sub>) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q<sub>0</sub>.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp10416144" data-alt="The graph shows the supply and demand for financial capital that includes the foreign sector.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp43945264">Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. As the U.S. debt increases, debt servicing will increase&#8212;that is, more current income will be used to pay the interest rate on past debt. Increasing U.S. debt also means that businesses may have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money, because business is now competing with the government for financial resources.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20248448">Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors&#8217; for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the supply curve shift from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty </div><figcaption>The graph shows the demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before and after the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp22317904">Step 4. Thus, foreign investors&#8217; diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E<sub>1</sub>, which occurs at the higher interest rate, R<sub>1</sub>, and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q<sub>1</sub>.</p>
</div></section>















<p id="fs-idm106753776">The economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2014, U.S. investors had accumulated $24.6 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign investors owned a total of $30.8 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their money out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower quantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in borrowing.</p><p id="fs-idm65088464">In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between one bank account and another. Yet these flows of funds can be analyzed with the same tools of demand and supply as markets for goods or labor.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm168437632"><h1 data-type="title">Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws</h1>
<p id="fs-idm166309472">As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.</p><p id="fs-idm124541424">Consider the credit card market as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and businesses; suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R<sub>0</sub> that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The price ceiling is shown by the horizontal dashed line in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The demand and supply model predicts that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q<sub>0</sub> to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q<sub>0</sub> to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C04_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example </div><figcaption>The original intersection of demand D and supply S occurs at equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>. However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium interest rate R<sub>0</sub>, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded, Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also called a shortage.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm124840240" data-alt="The graph shows the results of an interest rate that is set at the price ceiling, both beneath the equilibrium interest rate">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm107383360">Many states do have <span data-type="term">usury laws</span>, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge. However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm160556896" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm59102720">In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the &#8220;price&#8221; is the rate of return or the interest rate received. The quantity is measured by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those who demand it.</p>
<p id="fs-idm68893216">Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their existing levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other investments. Factors that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence in the future&#8212;since financial investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.</p>

  <p id="fs-idp42258080">Prices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant to the market&#8212;namely, the relationship between demand and supply&#8212;and then serving as messengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person&#8217;s preferences and budget set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the <span data-type="term" class="no emphasis">demand and supply models</span>.</p>















<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm202385216" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Why are demand and supply curves important?</div>
<p id="fs-idm134993216">The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model introduced in the <a href="/contents/7b6fbc95-85e5-4488-9023-6260c8090e19@2" class="target-chapter">Choice in a World of Scarcity</a> chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples; it is a model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyze <em data-effect="italics">any</em> market.</p><p id="fs-idp39548608"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.</p><p id="fs-idp13199744">The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at each price&#8212;that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves&#8212;and how these forces will combine to produce equilibrium.</p>
<p id="fs-idp103587600">Demand and supply can also be used to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right or to shift left; or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts; when there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.</p>

<p id="fs-idm121680688">An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage and the product should perhaps be economized on. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is high. Or, maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at the price of a ticket and decide whether and when to fly.</p>







<p id="fs-idp39195632">In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Or perhaps the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. But the oat farmer does not need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production as a result.</p>







<p id="fs-idp75042176">The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price controls</span> can be so counterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: &#8220;Don&#8217;t kill the messenger.&#8221; In ancient times, messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. But killing the messenger did not kill the bad news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.</p><p id="fs-idm4255632">Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger&#8212;or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. But price controls do nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China&#8217;s &#8220;Great Leap Forward&#8221; in the late 1950s, food prices were kept artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. Changes in demand and supply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers&#8217; and producers&#8217; behavior. Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this information, it becomes difficult for everyone&#8212;buyers and sellers alike&#8212;to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur throughout the economy.</p>

<p id="fs-idm31406704">The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C04_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows.

</figure><p id="fs-idp37909408">Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees.

</figure><p id="fs-idp177707152">While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know they will have higher salaries.  The situation of the labor market for nurses described in the beginning of the chapter is different from this example, because instead of a shrinking supply, we had the supply growing at a lower rate than the growth in demand. Since both curves were shifting to the right, we would have an unequivocal increase in the quantity of nurses. And because the shift in the demand curve was larger than the one in the supply, we would expect higher wages as a result.</p>

<p id="fs-idp82262320">The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative scarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and demand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation of resources.</p>

<p id="fs-idp35821520">The 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. The late 2000s, from 2007 to 2014 were not. What causes the economy to expand or contract? Why do businesses fail when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their jobs when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a failure of the market system? Are they a failure of the government? These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to address in this chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the economy doing? How can we tell?</p><p id="fs-idp13113280">The macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and consumption; everything that goes on in every market in the economy. How can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago, during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his economic advisers knew things were bad&#8212;but how could they express and measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the entire economy is producing. The result&#8212;gross domestic product (GDP)&#8212;remains our basic measure of macroeconomic activity. In this chapter, you will learn how GDP is constructed, how it is used, and why it is so important.</p>

    <p id="fs-idm15432384">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
    <ul id="fs-idm124053440">

<p id="fs-idp20669360">Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they interact). What causes recessions? What makes unemployment stay high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others? These are all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity of all households and all businesses in all markets to get the overall demand and supply in the economy. However, when we do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level is different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. Indeed, what seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view can have unexpected or counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are sitting at an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball game. A few people decide that they want a better view, and so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people, and the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level&#8212;to stand up for a better view&#8212;ended up being self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but it is an apt analogy.</p>







<p id="fs-idm16949040">Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it? <a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the structure we will use. We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp3974144"><h1 data-type="title">Goals</h1>
<p id="fs-idp3562320">In thinking about the overall health of the macroeconomy, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.
      </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="fs-idm95757952" data-bullet-style="bullet"><div data-type="item">Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economic growth is measured by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth rate of more than 3% is considered good.</div>
        <div data-type="item">Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force who do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the result is lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more than a statistic&#8212;it represents people&#8217;s livelihoods. While measured unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, a measured unemployment rate of 5% or less is considered low (good).</div>
        <div data-type="item">Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices, and is measured by the consumer price index. If many people face a situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and healthcare are rising much faster than the wages they receive for their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as their standard of living declines. For that reason, low inflation&#8212;an inflation rate of 1&#8211;2%&#8212;is a major goal.</div>
      </div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp19548848"><h1 data-type="title">Frameworks</h1>
<p id="fs-idp57525856">As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools used by economists are theories and models (see <a href="/contents/0920969f-c95c-457d-b5ec-ee6360ffacab@2" class="target-chapter">Welcome to Economics!</a> for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand; in macroeconomics, we use the theories of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand (AD)</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate supply (AS)</span>. This book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective, each of which has its own version of AD and AS. Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of what drives the macroeconomy.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp18810896"><h1 data-type="title">Policy Tools</h1>
<p id="fs-idp21692256">National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first is monetary policy, which involves managing the money supply and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in government spending/purchases and taxes.</p>
<p id="fs-idp17886240">Each of the items in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> will be explained in detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these things, you will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.</p>

<p id="fs-idp51723072">Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy.</p>







<p id="fs-idp61758576">How large is the U.S. economy? The size of a nation&#8217;s overall economy is typically measured by its <span data-type="term">gross domestic product (GDP)</span>, which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services&#8212;smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new goods and services produced in the current year&#8212;and summing them into a total dollar value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In 2014, the U.S. GDP totaled $17.4 trillion, the largest GDP in the world.</p><p id="fs-idm27220272">Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. The GDP of an economy can be measured either by the total dollar value of what is purchased in the economy, or by the total dollar value of what is produced. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm74303216"><h1 data-type="title">GDP Measured by Components of Demand</h1>
<p id="fs-idm69970080">Who buys all of this production? This <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand</span> can be divided into four main parts: consumer spending (consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending on net exports.

<p id="fs-idp2728208">What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to the purchase of stocks and bonds or the trading of financial assets. It refers to the purchase of new capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction, and inventories. Inventories that are produced this year are included in this year&#8217;s GDP&#8212;even if they have not yet sold. From the accountant&#8217;s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2014 was almost $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></div>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C19_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">Components of GDP on the Demand Side </div><figcaption>(a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, but it moves relatively little over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it increases and declines more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is around 20% of GDP. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists.

  </figure><p id="fs-idm59542880">Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers&#8217; spending decisions are a major driver of the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much.</p>
<p id="fs-idm139850480"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Investment expenditure</span> refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, these expenditures are counted under business investment. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Investment demand</span> is far smaller than <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumption demand</span>, typically accounting for only about 15&#8211;18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile; new technology or a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back sharply.</p>
<p id="fs-idm70032704">If you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the recession of 2009, you have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the United States is about 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local government spending). A significant portion of government budgets are transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran&#8217;s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. These payments are excluded from GDP because the government does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others.

<p id="fs-idp2343696">Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of retail sales. These figures are adjusted with foreign trade data to account for exports that are produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.</p>
<p id="fs-idp36393760">For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical capital equipment.</p>
<p id="fs-idm30437440">For what is purchased by the federal government, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because a lot of government spending at all levels involves hiring people to provide services, a large portion of government spending is also tracked through payroll records collected by state governments and by the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3875856">With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and adjustment is made for financial services that are produced in the United States for foreign customers.</p>
<p id="fs-idp97158000">Many other sources contribute to the estimates of GDP. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. Information on healthcare is collected by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on farming.</p>
<p id="fs-idp90395328">All of these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis (every three months). These numbers are then &#8220;annualized&#8221; by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, these estimates are updated and revised. The &#8220;advance&#8221; estimate of GDP for a certain quarter is released one month after a quarter. The &#8220;preliminary&#8221; estimate comes out one month after that. The &#8220;final&#8221; estimate is published one month later, but it is not actually final. In July, roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year are released. Then, once every five years, after the results of the latest detailed five-year business census have been processed, the BEA revises all of the past estimates of GDP according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.</p>

<p id="fs-idp31338800">When thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to count spending on exports&#8212;domestically produced goods that are sold abroad. By the same token, we must also subtract spending on imports&#8212;goods produced in other countries that are purchased by residents of this country. The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of imports (M), (X &#8211; M). The gap between exports and imports is called the <span data-type="term">trade balance</span>. If a country&#8217;s exports are larger than its imports, then a country is said to have a <span data-type="term">trade surplus</span>. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b).</p>
<p id="fs-idp42167040">Since the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a <span data-type="term">trade deficit</span> in most years. Indeed, the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines during the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Recession</span> between 2008 and 2009. As noted before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.</p>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp38511648">In thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone calls.</p>
<p id="fs-idp35319888">Even within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small category that refers to the goods that have been produced by one business but have not yet been sold to consumers, and are still sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if business is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp98408752"><h1 data-type="title">The Problem of Double Counting</h1>
<p id="fs-idp104208128">GDP is defined as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of <span data-type="term">double counting</span>, in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer, and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires. In this example, the value of the tires would have been counted twice-because the price of the truck includes the value of the tires.</p>
<p id="fs-idp154844816">To avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count just the value of <span data-type="term">final goods and services</span> in the chain of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes. <span data-type="term">Intermediate goods</span>, which are goods that go into the production of other goods, are excluded from GDP calculations. From the example above, only the value of the Ford truck will be counted. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of the production chain.</p>
<p id="fs-idp118183984">The concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced in the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than $16 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP&#8212;along with how it is changing every few months&#8212;is a full-time job for a brigade of government statisticians.</p>

<p id="fs-idp76615216">Notice the items that are not counted into GDP, as outlined in <a href="#Table_19_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The sales of used goods are not included because they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year&#8217;s GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid &#8220;under the table&#8221; and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is impossible to track these sales. In a recent study by Friedrich Schneider of shadow economies, the underground economy in the United States was estimated to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone. Transfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not represent production. Also, production of some goods&#8212;such as home production as when you make your breakfast&#8212;is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp98500912" class="note economics linkup">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12355168"><h1 data-type="title">Other Ways to Measure the Economy</h1>
<p id="fs-idp32767312">Besides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that GDP can be thought of as total production and as total purchases. It can also be thought of as total income since anything produced and sold produces income.</p>
<p id="fs-idm67605408">One of the closest cousins of GDP is the <span data-type="term">gross national product (GNP)</span>. GDP includes only what is produced within a country&#8217;s borders. GNP adds what is produced by domestic businesses and labor abroad, and subtracts out any payments sent home to other countries by foreign labor and businesses located in the United States. In other words, GNP is based more on the production of citizens and firms of a country, wherever they are located, and GDP is based on what happens within the geographic boundaries of a certain country. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be substantial.</p>
<p id="fs-idp32378176"><span data-type="term">Net national product (NNP)</span> is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and loses value is called <span data-type="term">depreciation</span>. The NNP can be further subdivided into <span data-type="term">national income</span>, which includes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to people.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51237184">For practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these differences exist and to know what statistic you are looking at, so that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of how these calculations work, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm28040352" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm29037568">The size of a nation&#8217;s economy is commonly expressed as its gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year. GDP is measured by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, it can be measured either by the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.</p>
<p id="fs-idm49517808">Demand can be divided into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. What is produced in the economy can be divided into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.</p>

<p id="fs-idp74345040">When examining economic statistics, there is a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the rate of inflation, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The <span data-type="term">nominal value</span> of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time. The <span data-type="term">real value</span> refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it is the real value that is more important.</p>

<p id="fs-idp74423248">If an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in 2010, it might appear that national output had risen by a factor of twenty-seven over this time (that is, GDP of $14,958 billion in 2010 divided by GDP of $543 billion in 1960). This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that nominal GDP is defined as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. This can be easily done, using the GDP deflator.</p>

<p id="fs-idm54895840"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in 1960). Clearly, much of the apparent growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated dollars of 1990&#8212;and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where</p>

What this means is that when we &#8220;deflate&#8221; nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index).

<p id="fs-idp27644864">There are a couple things to notice here. Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a special role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices are used to compute the real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this case, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real GDP is labeled &#8220;Constant Dollars&#8221; or &#8220;2005 Dollars,&#8221; which means that real GDP is constructed using prices that existed in 2005. The formula used is:</p>

The black line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars, where all dollar values have been converted to 2005 dollars. Since real GDP is expressed in 2005 dollars, the two lines cross in 2005. However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the years before 2005, because dollars were worth less in 2005 than in previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear lower in the years after 2005, because dollars were worth more in 2005 than in later years.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm40677904">The nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after adjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real, inflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to convert the measurements so that they are measured in the money prevailing in the base year.</p>

<p id="fs-idp94661760">When news reports indicate that &#8220;the economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter,&#8221; the reports are referring to the percentage change in real GDP. By convention, GDP growth is reported at an annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, it is multiplied by four when it is reported as if the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.</p>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp4304016"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C19_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900. The generally upward long-term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short-term declines. A significant decline in real GDP is called a <span data-type="term">recession</span>. An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a <span data-type="term">depression</span>. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Depression</span> of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure, as is the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Recession</span> of 2008&#8211;2009.</p>







<p id="fs-idp75162576">Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.</p>







<p id="fs-idp2371200">The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of the workers they have. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best&#8212;or they may even be asked to take pay cuts.</p>







<p id="fs-idm76443104"><a href="#Table_19_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. The highest point of the economy, before the recession begins, is called the <span data-type="term">peak</span>; conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before a recovery begins, is called the <span data-type="term">trough</span>. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak. The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the <span data-type="term">business cycle</span>. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960. The most recent recession started in December 2007 and ended formally in June 2009. This was the most severe recession since the Great Depression of the 1930&#8217;s.</p>

<p id="fs-idp29009152">A private think tank, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</span>, is the official tracker of business cycles for the U.S. economy.

<p id="fs-idm24831088">Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the same amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle. When GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions begin at the peak of the business cycle and end at the trough.</p>

<p id="fs-idp76215024">It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard of living in a nation. When comparing the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, the GDP of a country is measured in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has roughly three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. So, if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp104237568"><h1 data-type="title">Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp119037824">To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a &#8220;common denominator&#8221; using an <span data-type="term">exchange rate</span>, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A&#8217;s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B&#8217;s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British pounds per Japanese yen). Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose, market exchange rates and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">purchasing power parity (PPP)</span> equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, PPP-equivalent exchange rates are typically used for cross country comparisons of GDP. Exchange rates will be discussed in more detail in <a href="/contents/53108975-2b0a-4253-a2f5-4bc26be84000@2" class="target-chapter">Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows</a>. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common currency.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp177689456" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Converting GDP to a Common Currency</div>
<p id="fs-idp78630736">Using the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to compare Brazil&#8217;s GDP in 2013 of 4.8 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $16.6 trillion for the same year.</p><p id="fs-idp177123056">Step 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2013, the exchange rate was 2.230 reals = $1. (These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)</p><p id="fs-idp174916112">Step 2. Convert Brazil&#8217;s GDP into U.S. dollars:</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm10916128"><h1 data-type="title">GDP Per Capita</h1>
<p id="fs-idp107571648">The U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable amount. The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China and India. So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? This question can be answered by calculating a country&#8217;s <span data-type="term">GDP per capita</span>; that is, the GDP divided by the population.</p>

India has a somewhat larger GDP than Germany, but on a per capita basis, Germany has more than 10 times India&#8217;s standard of living.

<p id="fs-idp54033968">As shown in <a href="#Table_19_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, China has the second largest GDP of the countries: $9.5 trillion compared to the United States&#8217; $16.8 trillion. Perhaps it will surpass the United States, but probably not any time soon. China has a much larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fifth that of the United States ($6,958.70 compared to $53,001). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed countries. One caveat: For reasons to be discussed shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the differences in living standards across countries.</p></div>

Middle-income countries, which include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the range of $6,000 to $12,000. The low-income countries in the world, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often have GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.</p>

<p id="fs-idm13552208">Since GDP is measured in a country&#8217;s currency, in order to compare different countries&#8217; GDPs, we need to convert them to a common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate, which is the price of one country&#8217;s currency in terms of another. Once GDPs are expressed in a common currency, we can compare each country&#8217;s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by population. Countries with large populations often have large GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of the wealth of a nation. A better measure is GDP per capita.</p>

<p id="fs-idm37474416">The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase &#8220;standard of living.&#8221; Most of the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.</p>







<p id="fs-idm35378304">&#8220;Standard of living&#8221; is a broader term than GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets, <span data-type="term">standard of living</span> includes all elements that affect people&#8217;s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the market or not. To illuminate the gap between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm56150080"><h1 data-type="title">Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living</h1>
<p id="fs-idm80721856">While GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours. The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as was shown in <a href="/contents/87f107a9-e26f-4586-9ff7-acdca51e9e8e@3#Table_19_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average German worker. The calculation of GDP does not take the German worker&#8217;s extra weeks of vacation into account.</p><p id="fs-idm142764656">While GDP includes what is spent on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.</p>
<p id="fs-idm18645872">GDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that, as of 1970, only about 42% of women participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in the paid labor force according to the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. As women are now in the labor force, many of the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed.</p>
<p id="fs-idm69316080">GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP per capita</span> is only an average. When GDP per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less&#8212;or even declined. GDP also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others&#8212;it just looks at whether the total amount spent on bread is the same.</p>
<p id="fs-idm67381312">Likewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had&#8212;it was also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.</p>
<p id="fs-idm11716880">In certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installation of bars and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off. In that same vein, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society&#8217;s standard of living.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm98523920"><h1 data-type="title">Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp1151616">The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3636768">In some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since 1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. New technologies have been developed for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities created by new technology, or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.</p>
<p id="fs-idm172779168">On the other side, rates of crime, levels of traffic congestion, and inequality of incomes are higher in the United States now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that used to be provided, primarily by women, in the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that is counted by GDP. By ignoring these factors, GDP would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm128307504"><h1 data-type="title">GDP is Rough, but Useful</h1>
<p id="fs-idm54792672">A high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly. Even though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure production well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and incomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.</p>
<p id="fs-idm87860608">No single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as &#8220;standard of living.&#8221; Nonetheless, GDP per capita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm91829728" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?</div>
<p id="fs-idm48284112">To determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation&#8217;s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.</p>
<p id="fs-idm58323504">The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge&#8212;as of the third quarter of 2013, $16.6 trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the recession of 2008&#8211;2009 was a severe one and that the recovery from that has been slow, but is improving. GDP per capita gives a rough estimate of a nation&#8217;s standard of living. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related and what causes them to rise or fall.</p>

<p id="fs-idm39604992">GDP is an indicator of a society&#8217;s standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator.

<p id="fs-idm81170304">On average, humans need about 2,500 calories a day to survive, depending on height, weight, and gender. The economist Brad DeLong estimates that the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him 2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred years later, that same worker could afford 3,000 food calories. However, between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic growth was so rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000 food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an affluent Western European/North American country could afford to purchase 2.4 million food calories per day.</p>
<p id="fs-idm213686688">What caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875 and thereafter? Why is it that many countries, especially those in Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their populations more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at these and other questions as we examine long-run economic growth.</p>

<p id="fs-idm156621680">Every country worries about economic growth. In the United States and other high-income countries, the question is whether economic growth continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income countries like South Korea, Brazil, Egypt, or Poland catch up to the higher-income countries? Or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income? Of the world&#8217;s population of roughly 6.7 billion people, about 2.6 billion are scraping by on incomes that average less than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of living 2,000 years ago. Can the world&#8217;s poor be lifted from their fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E. Lucas Jr., once noted: &#8220;The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.&#8221;</p>







<p id="fs-idm217226208">Dramatic improvements in a nation&#8217;s standard of living are possible. After the Korean War in the late 1950s, the Republic of Korea, often called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most South Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British economist Angus Maddison, whose life&#8217;s work was the measurement of GDP and population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars was $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first century, a time period well within the lifetime and memory of many adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades, GDP per capita increased by more than 6% per year. According to the World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000 in nominal terms, placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand, and Israel. Measured by total GDP in 2012, South Korea is the thirteenth-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 49 million people, this transformation is extraordinary.</p>







<p id="fs-idm124954880">South Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid and sustained economic growth. Other nations of East Asia, like Thailand and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown enormously since market-oriented economic reforms were enacted around 1980. GDP per capita in high-income economies like the United States also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the Civil War, the U.S. economy has been transformed from a primarily rural and agricultural economy to an economy based on services, manufacturing, and technology.</p>

<p id="fs-idm75409712">Let&#8217;s begin with a brief overview of the spectacular patterns of economic growth around the world in the last two centuries, commonly referred to as the period of <span data-type="term">modern economic growth</span>. (Later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level, the average person&#8217;s standard of living had not changed much for centuries.</p><p id="fs-idm9848992">Progressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Jan Luiten van Zanden</span>, slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The <span data-type="term">Industrial Revolution</span> refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines&#8212;the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive&#8212;performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.</p><p id="fs-idm118026272">The jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average rate of growth of GDP per capita in the leading industrialized countries has averaged about 2% per year. What were times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.</p>







<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm50418048" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What were economic conditions like before 1870?</div>
<p id="fs-idp4012928">Angus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. His methods recently have been refined and used to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. to 1348. <a href="#Table_20_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. The declines in income are explained by a wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress. Institutions are the traditions, laws, and so on by which people in a community agree to behave and govern themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.</p>
<p id="fs-idm45336608">One example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. This concept was later adopted by the United States in its own constitution. This social order may have contributed to England&#8217;s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of northern Italy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm25422624">In the study of economic growth, a country&#8217;s institutional framework plays a critical role. <a href="#Table_20_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not shown in table).</p>
<table id="Table_20_01" summary="This table has eight rows and nine columns. The first row is a header row and it labels each column: &#8220;Year&#8221;, &#8220;Northern Italy&#8221;, &#8220;Spain&#8221;, &#8220;England&#8221;, &#8220;Holland&#8221;, &#8220;Byzantium&#8221;, &#8220;Iraq&#8221;, &#8220;Egypt&#8221;, and &#8220;Japan&#8221;.

      </tbody></table><p id="fs-idm87779344">Another fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of income, compared to others at that time, attained by the Islamic Empire Abbasid Caliphate&#8212;which was founded in present-day Iraq in 730 C.E. At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.</p>

<p id="fs-idp94022480">The Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP per capita of the world&#8217;s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.</p>







<p id="fs-idp70854560">However, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible. Japan&#8217;s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging 11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not uncommon. More recently, China, with its population of 1.3 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s. India, with a population of 1.1 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.</p>

<p id="fs-idm56842384">These waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.3 billion) and India (population: 1.1 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.</p>







<p id="fs-idm17159200">Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Richard Easterlin</span>, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:</p>







<p id="fs-idm39476224">
      </p><blockquote id="fs-idm9703152">By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live longer, and are better educated. Women&#8217;s lives are less centered on reproduction and political democracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one of universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world&#8217;s population ever achieved in such a brief span of time.</blockquote>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm99148224"><h1 data-type="title">Rule of Law and Economic Growth</h1>
<p id="fs-idm68399792">Economic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the <span data-type="term">rule of law</span> and protection of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">property rights</span> and <span data-type="term">contractual rights</span> by a country&#8217;s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society. Property rights, as you might recall from <a href="/contents/e3af44f9-4260-4a82-b34c-41082b88656a@2" class="target-chapter">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities</a> are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is what determines your livelihood. The use of this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.</p><p id="fs-idp68243472">Contractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects to get paid. Failure to pay would constitute a theft of property by the patient; that property being the services provided by the surgeon. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of the patient&#8211;surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.</p>
<p id="fs-idm12026608">The World Bank considers a country&#8217;s legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries&#8217; legal systems based on effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe; their GDP per capita was $679, $333, and $1,007 respectively. Afghanistan is cited by the World Bank as having a low standard of living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had declining growth since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idp1813120">Since the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular process of long-run economic growth during which the world&#8217;s leading economies&#8212;mostly those in Western Europe and North America&#8212;expanded GDP per capita at an average rate of about 2% per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and China have shown the potential to catch up. The extensive process of economic growth, often referred to as modern economic growth, was facilitated by the Industrial Revolution, which increased worker productivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.</p></section>

    </div>
    <div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idp106247248"><p id="fs-idp96026384">Property rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. Contractual rights are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. Economic growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy, which occurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For this to happen, societies must create a legal environment that gives individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and highest use, including the right to trade or sell that property. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idp60744976">Sustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? <span data-type="term">Labor productivity</span> is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the Canadians are more productive. Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere.</p>







<p id="fs-idm75246784">What determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital. <span data-type="term">Human capital</span> is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience), skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.</p>







<p id="fs-idm112616864">The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. <span data-type="term">Technological change</span> is a combination of <span data-type="term">invention</span>&#8212;advances in knowledge&#8212;and <span data-type="term">innovation</span>, which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices. These devices can be used to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less time, improving worker productivity.</p>







<p id="fs-idm88141104">The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in <a href="/contents/ce25f862-2006-459e-86aa-fa6bb6da2deb@4" class="target-chapter">Cost and Industry Structure</a>.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard residential size oven.</p><p id="fs-idp59009248">Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let&#8217;s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp131994656"><h1 data-type="title">Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function</h1>
<p id="fs-idp1057376">To analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a <span data-type="term">production function</span>, which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers. A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm, or perhaps an industry. In macroeconomics, the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an <span data-type="term">aggregate production function</span>.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp72654720"><h1 data-type="title">Components of the Aggregate Production Function</h1>
<p id="fs-idp129571360">Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp2749200"><h1 data-type="title">Measuring Productivity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm219632">An economy&#8217;s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital.</p>
<p id="fs-idm117036800">A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer&#8217;s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled about 106 in 2014. In 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947&#8211;2011 </div><figcaption>Output per hour worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line.

  </figure><p id="fs-idp101193536">According to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">Productivity Growth Since 1950 </div><figcaption>U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1950 and 1970. It then declined to lower levels in the 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit in the 2000s. Some think the productivity rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a &#8220;new economy&#8221; built on higher productivity growth, but this cannot be determined until more time has passed.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp124756960"><h1 data-type="title">The &#8220;New Economy&#8221; Controversy</h1>
<p id="fs-idp171750800">In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a &#8220;new economy&#8221; based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come. The pessimists, on the other hand, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep recession of 2008&#8211;2009, with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down since then. </p><p id="fs-idp123959040"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Productivity growth</span> is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm165954064"><h1 data-type="title">The Power of Sustained Economic Growth</h1>
<p id="fs-idp4367424">Nothing is more important for people&#8217;s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider <a href="#Table_20_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:</p><div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm69555584"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><msup><mtext>GDP&#160;at&#160;starting&#160;date&#160;&#215;&#160;(1&#160;+&#160;growth&#160;rate&#160;of&#160;GDP)</mtext><mtext>years</mtext></msup><mtext>&#160;=&#160;GDP&#160;at&#160;end&#160;date</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><msup><mtext>GDP&#160;at&#160;starting&#160;date&#160;&#215;&#160;(1&#160;+&#160;growth&#160;rate&#160;of&#160;GDP)</mtext><mtext>years</mtext></msup><mtext>&#160;=&#160;GDP&#160;at&#160;end&#160;date</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idm124631072">For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)<sup>25</sup> = 209.</p>
<p id="fs-idm36351808">The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan, Korea, and China.</p>
<p id="fs-idm142898656"><a href="#Table_20_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth&#8212;from 100 to 163&#8212;over just 10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45.</p>

<p id="fs-idp62019152">Productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, can be measured as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded (the current global recession notwithstanding). It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy&#8217;s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy, like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.</p>
<p id="fs-idm32606464">Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.</p>

<p id="fs-idm35489024">Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.</p>







<p id="fs-idm109963376">The category of <span data-type="term">physical capital</span> includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads (also called <span data-type="term">infrastructure</span>). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two ways: (1) an increase in the <em data-effect="italics">quantity</em> of physical capital (for example, more computers of the same quality); and (2) an increase in the <em data-effect="italics">quality</em> of physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are faster, and so on). Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays off in longer-term productivity in the future.</p>















<p id="fs-idm87191888">The category of <span data-type="term">technology</span> is the &#8220;joker in the deck.&#8221; Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, the development of more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.</p>







<p id="fs-idm34854128">It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in population size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person, it is often useful to focus on <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP per capita</span>. Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with countries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.</p>







<p id="fs-idm58595856">To obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in <a href="/contents/32dbf9b4-5fa3-4091-8bd7-306335dd3d1b@5#CNX_Econ_C20_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>(a) by the population. This creates a second <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate production function</span> where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person&#8212;see <a href="/contents/32dbf9b4-5fa3-4091-8bd7-306335dd3d1b@5#CNX_Econ_C20_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>(b). The result of having population in the denominator is mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population is important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human and physical capital.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm111173184"><h1 data-type="title">Capital Deepening</h1>
<p id="fs-idm75123600">When society increases the level of capital per person, the result is called <span data-type="term">capital deepening</span>. The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker.</p>
<p id="fs-idm109566352">Recall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S. population with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma; by the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades. Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher average level of work experience.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_010"><div data-type="title" class="title">Human Capital Deepening in the U.S. </div><figcaption>Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, relatively few U.S. adults have completed a four-year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur.

We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early 2000s.

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm64704752">Not only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of technological marvels is all around us&#8212;discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless Internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</span> typically has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.</p>
<p id="fs-idm66378624">This recipe for economic growth&#8212;investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and technology, as well as increasing physical capital&#8212;also applies to other economies. In South Korea, for example, universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade in the United States) had already been achieved by 1965, when Korea&#8217;s GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s, Korea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in the United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea&#8217;s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30&#8211;35% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to technology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to get scientific and technical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea&#8217;s high rate of economic growth.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm70437712"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Accounting Studies</h1>
<p id="fs-idm53511744">Since the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in physical capital and human capital. These two inputs can be measured, at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured these three main factors over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.</p>
<p id="fs-idm88798768">First, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.</p>
<p id="fs-idm117632336">Second, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years after World War II (1939&#8211;1945). During the war, a large share of Europe&#8217;s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic framework, rebuilt Europe&#8217;s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.</p>
<p id="fs-idm53554320">A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly impact lives.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm124656544" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How do girls&#8217; education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?</div>
<p id="fs-idm150989568">In the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school&#8212;and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Bangladesh, for example, the illiteracy rate for those aged 15 to 24 was 78% for females, compared to 75% for males. In Egypt, for this age group, illiteracy was 84% for females and 91% for males. Cambodia had 86% illiteracy for females and 88% for males. Nigeria had 66% illiteracy for females in the 15 to 24 age bracket and 78% for males.</p>
<p id="fs-idm59283424">Whenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm67668496">Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated children. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women get one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women get one additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with benefits beyond the current generation.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm25378768"><h1 data-type="title">A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth</h1>
<p id="fs-idm54570720">While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a nation&#8217;s well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a healthy economic climate.</p>
<p id="fs-idm2737024">A healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.</p>
<p id="fs-idm27929936">A general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a whole. The role of the government is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:

      </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="fs-idm16861680" data-bullet-style="bullet"><div data-type="item">Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school (<em data-effect="italics">Folkeskole</em>) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend <em data-effect="italics">Folkeskole</em>. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies vouchers to citizens who choose private school.</div>
        <div data-type="item">Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, private investment is taxed. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.</div>
        <div data-type="item">Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately economic growth.</div>
        <div data-type="item">Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government-supported <span data-type="term">special economic zones (SEZ)</span>. These are areas of the country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or surrender to protectionism.</div>
        <div data-type="item">Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The researchers <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Abraham Garc&#237;a</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pierre Mohnen</span> demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies. Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.</div>
      </div>
<p id="fs-idm92341040">There are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth; we explore them in other chapters and in particular in <a href="/contents/01f8a707-529f-4a3c-a5c6-bec019d1001a@3" class="target-chapter">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a>. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp108923712" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idp73201952">Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or physical capital per worker. Technology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of production, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of management or other types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with supportive public policies and institutions.</p>

<p id="fs-idm67231968">Some low-income and middle-income economies around the world have shown a pattern of <span data-type="term">convergence</span>, in which their economies grow faster than those of high-income countries.

The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent members of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world&#8217;s population. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>

<p id="fs-idp35475936">Several arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic growth in the future.</p>
<p id="fs-idp99760800">A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">law of diminishing returns</span> suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor&#8217;s degree, would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to $15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.</p>
<p id="fs-idp39992416">Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels achieved by the high-income countries.</p>
<p id="fs-idp119486112">A second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-income countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood. The economist <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Alexander Gerschenkron</span> (1904&#8211;1978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: &#8220;the advantages of backwardness.&#8221; Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.</p>
<p id="fs-idp38943136">Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more quickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher standard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help provide this standard of living.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp59787168"><h1 data-type="title">Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely</h1>
<p id="fs-idp12807792">If the growth of an economy depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then the growth rate of that economy would be expected to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1086000">The development of new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C20_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how. The horizontal axis of the figure measures the amount of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human capital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>. The vertical axis of the diagram measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is being held constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub> and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase&#8212;but the way in which the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will eventually set in.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C20_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">Capital Deepening and New Technology </div><figcaption>Imagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital C<sub>1</sub> and the output per capita at G<sub>1</sub>. If the economy relies only on capital deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>, technology improves from Technology 1 to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>, technology increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idp59986160" data-alt="The graph shows three upward arching lines that each represent a different technology. Improvements in technology lead to greater output per capita and deepened physical and human capital.">
      <img src="../resources/ce2406305b950e3e03dcdca34c23ae570ae37acf" data-media-type="image/jpeg" alt="The graph shows three upward arching lines that each represent a different technology. Improvements in technology lead to greater output per capita and deepened physical and human capital."></img>
    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp34932192">Now, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate production functions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp128469648">Most healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line (Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.</p>
<p id="fs-idp120690720">Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become continually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the Internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that the ideas of new technology can often be widely applied at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A specific additional machine, or an additional year of education, must be used by a specific worker or group of workers. A new technology or invention can be used by many workers across the economy at very low marginal cost.</p>
<p id="fs-idp74386992">The argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and using new technology, a society&#8217;s performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the economic, educational, and public policy institutions of the country are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain advantages is of little practical relevance.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm229577088"><h1 data-type="title">The Slowness of Convergence</h1>
<p id="fs-idm65881824">Although economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible and even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of $40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1 + 0.02)<sup>30</sup>) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is, $4,000 (1 + 0.07)<sup>30</sup>). Convergence has occurred; the rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down somewhat.</p>
<p id="fs-idm154221264">The slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in standard of living over decades&#8212;more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm143402080" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Calories and Economic Growth</div>
<p id="fs-idm229386256">The story of modern economic growth can be told by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical growth consensus uses the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate production function</span> to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more calories in 2014 than in 1875.</p>
<p id="fs-idm1085056">Aside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact, food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.</p>
<p id="fs-idp46503120">Because we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp30828912" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm52458544">When countries with lower levels of GDP per capita catch up to countries with higher levels of GDP per capita, the process is called convergence. Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase investment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP. This is because the impact of new investment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or equipment are combined with the labor force. In higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to that of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most likely has high levels of capital investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional investment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing returns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies; this allows lower-income economies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical capital.</p>

    </figure><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm122273584" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Mysterious Case of the Missing Candidates</div><p id="fs-idm64549360">Nearly eight million U.S. jobs were lost during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, with unemployment peaking at 10% in October 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That is a huge number of positions gone. During the tepid recovery, some positions were added, but as of summer 2013, unemployment had remained persistently higher than the pre-recession rate of less than 5%. Some economists and policymakers worried the recovery would be &#8220;jobless.&#8221; With the economy growing, albeit slowly, why wasn&#8217;t the unemployment number falling? Why were firms not hiring? </p>
     <p id="fs-idm86635488">Peter Cappelli, noted Wharton management professor and Director of Wharton&#8217;s Center for Human Resources, does not believe the job search process is akin to what he terms the &#8220;Home Depot&#8221; view of hiring. According to him, this view &#8220;basically says that filling a job is like replacing a part in a washing machine. You simply find someone who does the exact same job as that broken part, plug him or her into the washing machine and that is it.&#8221; The job search, for both the prospective employee and the employer, is more complex than that. </p>
     <p id="fs-idm57942432">In a hiring situation, employers hold all the cards. They write the job descriptions, determine the salaries, decide when and how to advertise positions, and set the controls on employment application screening software. Advertising for positions has increased as the economic recovery progresses, yet here&#8217;s the kicker: Employers say there are no applicants out there who meet their needs. While the unemployment rate is now below 6% as of the beginning of 2015, many economists and policymakers (including the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen) are still concerned about "slack" in the labor market. So the question arises: where are the job candidates? </p><p id="fs-idm122257040">That question leads us to the topic of this chapter&#8212;unemployment. What constitutes it? How is it measured? And if the economy is growing, why isn&#8217;t the pool of job openings growing along with it?  Sounds like the economy has a case of &#8220;missing&#8221; candidates. </p>

    <ul id="fs-idm27909488">
      <li> How the Unemployment Rate is Defined and Computed </li>
      <li> Patterns of Unemployment </li>
      <li> What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run </li>
      <li> What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run </li>
    </ul>
  </div><p id="fs-idm48605696">Unemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience&#8212;like a serious automobile accident or a messy divorce&#8212;whose consequences can be fully understood only by someone who has gone through it. For unemployed individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress of not knowing where the next paycheck is coming from. There are painful adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live. Even when the unemployed person finds a new job, it may pay less than the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of their self worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce, it can affect family relationships as well as mental and physical health. </p>







<p id="fs-idm112858096">The human costs of unemployment alone would justify making a low level of unemployment an important public policy priority. But unemployment also includes economic costs to the broader society. When millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot find jobs, an economic resource is going unused. An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">opportunity cost</span> of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers. </p>







<p id="fs-idm158459344">This chapter will discuss how the unemployment rate is defined and computed. It will examine the patterns of unemployment over time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups in the U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an economic explanation for unemployment, and how it explains the patterns of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it. </p>

<p id="fs-idp32600112">Unemployment is typically described in newspaper or television reports as a percentage or a rate. A recent report might have said, for example, <em data-effect="italics">from August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%</em>. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. But remember that the U.S. economy has about 155 million adults who either have jobs or are looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 155 million potential workers translates into 155,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with the unemployment rate now at 5.5% as of February 2015, about 8 million people total are out of work.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm28958448" class="note economics linkup"><p id="fs-idm144319776">The <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/BLS1">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> tracks and reports all data related to unemployment.</p><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp3270256" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL">

<p id="fs-idm36078976">Should everyone without a job be counted as unemployed? Of course not. Children, for example, should not be counted as unemployed. Surely, the retired should not be counted as unemployed. Many full-time college students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on parental leave.</p>
<p id="fs-idm48335872">The point is that the adult population is not just divided into employed and unemployed. A third group exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason&#8212;retirement, looking after children, taking a voluntary break before a new job&#8212;are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment. Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as <span data-type="term">out of the labor force</span> or not in the labor force. </p>
<p id="fs-idm9258832">The U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of questions to divide up the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.</p>
<p id="fs-idm11805664"><strong>Employed</strong>: currently working for pay</p><p id="fs-idp17516736"><strong>Unemployed</strong>: Out of work and actively looking for a job</p><p id="fs-idm14569088"><strong>Out of the labor force</strong>: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job</p><p id="fs-idp45924160"><strong>Labor force</strong>: the number of employed plus the unemployed</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm7306464"><h1 data-type="title">Hidden Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idp2207376">Even with the &#8220;out of the labor force&#8221; category, there are still some people that are mislabeled in the categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed, though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who are <span data-type="term">underemployed</span>. This includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk would be considered underemployed. They are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term &#8220;<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">hidden unemployment</span>.&#8221; <span data-type="term">Discouraged workers</span>, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence, are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm44716656"><h1 data-type="title">Labor Force Participation Rate</h1>
<p id="fs-idp42938000">Another important statistic is the <span data-type="term">labor force participation rate</span>. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. So, using the data in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#Table_21_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, those included in this calculation would be the 157 million individuals in the labor force. The rate is calculated by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.  For the data from February 2015, the labor force participation rate is 62.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce, and it peaked at around 68% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp24343456"><h1 data-type="title">The Establishment Payroll Survey</h1>
<p id="fs-idp24082832">When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on the number of jobs created&#8212;which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based on a survey of about 140,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and average hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the self-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs and full time jobs with &#8220;decent&#8221; pay.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm652304"><h1 data-type="title">How Is the U.S. Unemployment Data Collected?</h1>
<p id="fs-idm24714640">The unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics each month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which has been carried out every month since 1940. Great care is taken to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. The 729 areas are then divided into districts of about 300 households each, and each district is divided into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Households are interviewed for four consecutive months, then rotated out of the survey for eight months, and then interviewed again for the same four months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.</p>
<p id="fs-idp10099184">Based on this survey, unemployment rates are calculated by state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education. A wide variety of other information is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed person the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp20574064" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the difference between CPS and EPS?</div>
<p id="fs-idp3347344">The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll  survey (EPS) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a payroll survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp43412832"><h1 data-type="title">Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idp19293536">There are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but have gotten discouraged at the lack of available jobs in their area and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. But the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.</p><p id="fs-idp33195632">Although the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm108841264" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm63009776">Unemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals suffer from loss of income and from stress. An economy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. The adult population can be divided into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, those in the labor force are divided into employed and unemployed. A person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively looking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as being out of the labor force. The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons divided by the number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population). The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for the month.</p>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp5488880">As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:
      </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="fs-idm63330528" data-number-style="arabic"><div data-type="item"> Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007&#8211;2009, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.</div>
        <div data-type="item"> Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000 and near 5% during almost all of 2006&#8211;2007. The previous time unemployment had been less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.</div>
        <div data-type="item"> The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. Indeed, it never seems to get below 3%&#8212;and it stays that low only for very short periods. (Reasons why this is the case are discussed later in this chapter.)</div>
        <div data-type="item"> The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy. During periods of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">depression</span>, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.</div>
        <div data-type="item"> No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S. population nearly quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 314 million by 2012. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women composed 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2012. But despite the increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.</div>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp75705856">The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as &#8220;secondary&#8221; earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). During the recession of 2008-2009, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the unemployment rate for women. Through 2014, this pattern has remained, although the gap is narrowing.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp27881536" class="note economics linkup"><p id="fs-idp15122336">Read this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/BLS_recession">report</a> for detailed information on the recession of 2008&#8211;2009.

        </span>
    </div><p id="fs-idm23312496">Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs (and in and out of the labor force) more easily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows unemployment rates for women divided by age; the pattern for men is similar.</p>
<p id="fs-idm51055376">The unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained blacks&#8217; labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for whites and for blacks and Hispanics diminished in the 1990s, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c). In fact, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the recent Great Recession.</p>
<p id="fs-idm117723248">Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In February 2015, for example, the unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.7%; for those with some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate was 5.1%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the unemployment rate was 5.4%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 8.4%. This pattern may arise because additional education offers better connections to the labor market and higher demand, or it may occur because the labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers are less attractive than the opportunities for the more highly-skilled. Because of lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to find jobs.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idp34150336">However, cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates need to be treated with care, because each country has slightly different survey tools for measuring unemployment and also different labor markets. For example, Japan&#8217;s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan&#8217;s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan&#8217;s unemployment rate probably paints too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. This Japanese pattern is perhaps best viewed as an unusual method for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.</p>

    </div><p id="fs-idp5586432">Comparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">low-income countries</span>, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and food stamps; such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than in high-income countries.</p>

<p id="fs-idm26526080">The U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4% to 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the size of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like globalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26272224">Unemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanics than for whites; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women&#8217;s unemployment rates used to be higher than men&#8217;s, but in recent years men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s unemployment rates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared favorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.</p>

<p id="fs-idm54037408">We have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment? There are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let's look at the short run first.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm97198208"><h1 data-type="title">Cyclical Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm13398448">Let&#8217;s make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em> assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant factors.</p>
<p id="fs-idp15751696">One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">macro economy</span>. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the labor demand curve will shift to the left.  The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle) is known as <span data-type="term">cyclical unemployment</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm82946752">From the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">labor market</span> should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C21_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor Market </div><figcaption>In a labor market with flexible wages, the equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people looking for jobs (shown by S) equals the number of jobs available (shown by D).</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm24740880" data-alt="The graph reveals the complexity of unemployment in that, presumably, the number of jobs available should equal the number of individuals pursuing employment.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp15899712">One possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). But from an economist&#8217;s point of view, these people are choosing to be unemployed.</p>
<p id="fs-idp22192224">Probably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages similar to what is being received by those people. But the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed.  What causes <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">involuntary unemployment</span>?</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp52865680"><h1 data-type="title">Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward</h1>
<p id="fs-idp50963744">If a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well&#8212;because it predicts that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job&#8212;then it may prove useful to consider economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.</p>
<p id="fs-idm17603456">One set of reasons why wages may be &#8220;sticky downward,&#8221; as economists put it, involves economic laws and institutions. For low-skilled workers being paid the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">minimum wage</span>, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 150 million or so workers in the U.S. economy, only about 1.4 million&#8212;less than 2% of the total&#8212;are paid the minimum wage. Similarly, only about 12% of American wage and salary workers are represented by a labor union. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of workers. But for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about one-fifth or less of the labor force.</p>
<p id="fs-idp37482256">Economists looking for reasons why wages might be <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">sticky</span> downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. A number of different theories have been proposed, but they share a common tone.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10390944">One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an <span data-type="term">implicit contract</span>, which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave the firm.</p>
<p id="fs-idm32910176"><span data-type="term">Efficiency wage theory</span> argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20417568">The <span data-type="term">adverse selection of wage cuts argument</span> points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment alternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that are going through tough times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of the firm&#8217;s workers. But these stories are notable because they are so uncommon. It is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut wages for everyone.</p>
<p id="fs-idm62486976">The <span data-type="term">insider-outsider model</span> of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are &#8220;insiders,&#8221; while new employees, at least for a time, are &#8220;outsiders.&#8221; A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization, to be familiar with routine procedures, to train new employees, and so on. However, cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm&#8217;s productivity and prospects.</p><p id="fs-idp3604096">Finally, the <span data-type="term">relative wage coordination argument</span> points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead, workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard against wage cuts.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3534736">These theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or long-run unemployment can result. This can be seen in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C21_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">Sticky Wages in the Labor Market </div><figcaption>Because the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the number of job seekers (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment, shown by the bracket in the figure.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm6305424" data-alt="The graph provides a visual of how sticky wages impact the unemployment rate.">

  </figure><p id="fs-idm42987296">The interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward are shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.

Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been the new equilibrium wage (Q<sub>1</sub>), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve, the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers demanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (Q<sub>0</sub>) to Q<sub>2</sub>. The gap between the original equilibrium quantity (Q<sub>0</sub>) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q<sub>2</sub>) represents workers who would be willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of unemployment.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C21_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand? </div><figcaption>(a) In a labor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> leads to an increase in equilibrium quantity of labor hired from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub> and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>1</sub>. (b) In a labor market where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> leads to a decline in the quantity of labor demanded at the original wage (W<sub>0</sub>) from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub>. These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage (W<sub>0</sub>), but will not be able to find jobs.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm775360" data-alt="The graphs show how supply and demand influence unemployment.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp23583920">This analysis helps to explain the connection noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in recessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.</p>

  <p id="fs-idm9114576">Cyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will adjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the equilibrium wage. Many theories have been proposed for why wages might not be flexible, but instead may adjust only in a &#8220;sticky&#8221; way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts, efficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.</p>

      <p id="fs-idm40495296">Beginning in the 1970s and continuing for three decades, women entered the U.S. labor force in a big way. If we assume that wages are sticky in a downward direction, but that around 1970 the demand for labor equaled the supply of labor at the current wage rate, what do you imagine happened to the wage rate, employment, and unemployment as a result of increased labor force participation?</p>
    </div>
    <div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm22401408"><p id="fs-idp14556592">Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of labor shifts to the right. Since wages are sticky downward, the increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for jobs (Qs), but no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a result, unemployment increases by the amount of the increase in the labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure.</p><p id="fs-idp31545728">Over time, as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually wages will begin to increase again.

<p id="fs-idm115279984">Cyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic expansion. But what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times in the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing strongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years and bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy: it is called the <span data-type="term">natural rate of unemployment</span>.</p>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm11421040"><h1 data-type="title">The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm16193504">The natural rate of unemployment is not &#8220;natural&#8221; in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the &#8220;natural&#8221; rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social, and political factors that exist at a time&#8212;assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let&#8217;s discuss these factors in more detail.</p>
</section>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp13184672"><h1 data-type="title">Frictional Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm17579824">In a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">market economy</span>, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor management; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm&#8217;s product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign competitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. But in the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job. The unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as workers move between jobs, is called <span data-type="term">frictional unemployment</span>. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.</p>
<p id="fs-idp37208832">In the mid-2000s, before the recession of 2008&#8211;2009, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear in any three-month period. But in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.</p>
<p id="fs-idm133054000">Of course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into the new jobs being created, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South Carolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the adjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that they must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others must start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work, while others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results from people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total unemployment.</p>
<p id="fs-idm67007280">The level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs, which may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find jobs&#8212;which in turn may depend on history and culture.</p>
<p id="fs-idm31492384">Frictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population. <a href="/contents/ecc67502-4d82-4149-9377-92f46dc12fa0@2#CNX_Econ_C21_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25&#8211;54 years of age than they are for those who are either younger or older. &#8220;Prime-age workers,&#8221; as those in the 25&#8211;54 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and income arriving at all times. But some proportion of those who are under 30 may still be trying out jobs and life options and some proportion of those over 55 are eyeing retirement. In both cases, the relatively young or old tend to worry less about unemployment than those in-between, and their periods of frictional unemployment may be longer as a result. Thus, a society with a relatively high proportion of relatively young or old workers will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers in middle age.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp6751936"><h1 data-type="title">Structural Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm17651328">Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of <span data-type="term">structural unemployment</span>. The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned any skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50756880">Some people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no skills and little education, that option is more limited.</p>
</section>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp20544784"><h1 data-type="title">Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP</h1>
<p id="fs-idm72296736">The natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP. The economy is considered to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment. When the economy is at full employment, real GPD is equal to potential real GDP.  By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy above full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers working overtime.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm20378240"><h1 data-type="title">Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm19782864">Unexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time, the level of wages in an economy will be determined by the productivity of workers. After all, if a business paid workers more than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.</p>
<p id="fs-idm38118464">However, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Wages</span> are typically reviewed only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to observe, wage increases are often determined based on recent experience with productivity; if productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.</p>
<p id="fs-idm44086144">The U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as discussed in <a href="/contents/093b7e3a-77c6-4f91-a6c8-2eb7d1a9cc1f@2">Economic Growth</a>). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor&#8212;that is, the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage&#8212;has been shifting out a little each year because of rising productivity, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub>. As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>. But when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W<sub>2</sub> to W<sub>3</sub> to W<sub>4</sub>. But the demand for labor is no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W<sub>4</sub> is greater than the quantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises; indeed, in the aftermath of this unexpectedly low productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986. Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease back down. But this process may take years.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C21_015"><div data-type="title" class="title">Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment </div><figcaption>(a) Productivity is rising, increasing the demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops increasing. However, the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so wages keep rising as before. But the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage W<sub>4</sub>, unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. At the wage (W), this means that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm38683280" data-alt="The two graphs reveal how changes in productivity can impact wages and unemployment ">
      <img src="../resources/b5c378fe741de254cd6ed0a7fd5941783d659114" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The two graphs reveal how changes in productivity can impact wages and unemployment "></img>
    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idm48652544">The late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980&#8211;1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995&#8211;2001. Let&#8217;s simplify the situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C21_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), where the demand curve for labor (D<sub>0</sub>) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages were not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. At least for a time, however, wages are still being set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low&#8212;actually below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%&#8212;quite a low level by historical standards&#8212;from 1998 until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.</p><p id="fs-idm17202544">Average levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. But over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.</p>
</section>































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp35406592"><h1 data-type="title">Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idp53908704">Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of being unemployed is lower and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.</p>
<p id="fs-idp56881024">What seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely, government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp25139520" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How does U.S. unemployment insurance work?</div><p id="fs-idm26540064">Unemployment insurance is a joint federal&#8211;state program, established by federal law in 1935. The federal government sets minimum standards for the program, but most of the administration is done by state governments.</p>
<p id="fs-idp80289616">The funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires that the tax be collected on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that benefits will be paid, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks&#8212;with extensions possible in times of especially high unemployment. The fund is then used to pay benefits to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage earned by the person in his or her previous job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.</p>

    </div><p id="fs-idp34863488">On the demand side of the labor market, government rules social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that can be sold. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where business can be done, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.</p>
<p id="fs-idp54317808">Whatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value&#8212;like the value some Christians place on not working on Sunday&#8212;these kinds of restrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary&#8212;since laying these workers off would be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring those workers.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm33483552"><h1 data-type="title">The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years</h1>
<p id="fs-idp24082128">The underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.</p>
<p id="fs-idm21562224">Estimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. Three of the common reasons proposed by economists for this change are outlined below.
      </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="fs-idp30474432" data-number-style="arabic"><div data-type="item">The Internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An Internet search is far easier than trying to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources departments, requesting a list of jobs and application forms, and so on. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work as well.</div>
        <div data-type="item">The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies; by the early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or gotten any other way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.</div>
        <div data-type="item">The aging of the &#8220;baby boom generation&#8221;&#8212;the especially large generation of Americans born between 1946 and 1963&#8212;meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As noted earlier, middle-aged workers are far more likely to keep steady jobs than younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment.</div>
      </div>
<p id="fs-idp55520736">The combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 pushed monthly unemployment rates above 10% in late 2009. But even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%&#8212;lower than it currently is, though not by much. As of early 2015, policymakers still think that unemployment has not yet reached its natural rate.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm103651488"><h1 data-type="title">The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe</h1>
<p id="fs-idm22990544">By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy appears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions underlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much higher natural rate of unemployment.</p>
<p id="fs-idm46540112">Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have laws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker can be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance package can be as high as a year&#8217;s salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will surely discourage laying off or firing current workers. But when companies know that it will be difficult to fire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.</p>
<p id="fs-idm51535600">The typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years, which have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, are attributable to the fact that the sorts of laws and regulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the United States.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm6693376"><h1 data-type="title">A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm51762144">The <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@3">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a> and <a href="/contents/01f8a707-529f-4a3c-a5c6-bec019d1001a@3">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a> chapters provide a detailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when these policies can be discussed in the context of the full array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. But even at this preliminary stage, it is useful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.</p><p id="fs-idm6923168">The remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem, caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize recessions. As <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@3">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a> discusses, this policy can be enacted by stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible, which makes them eager to hire.</p><p id="fs-idm24297328">Dealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. There is not much to be done about the fact that in a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and fire workers. Nor is there much to be done about how the evolving age structure of the economy, or unexpected shifts in productivity, will affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many European countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will persist even when GDP is growing.</p>
<p id="fs-idm45019952">When a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies will affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to seek each other out. For example, the government may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. The design of government programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to employed workers may need to be rethought so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand may need to be redesigned so that they will not unduly discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that all laws affecting labor markets should be repealed, but only that when such laws are enacted, a society that cares about unemployment will need to consider the tradeoffs involved.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm24297072" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Mysterious Case of the Missing Candidates</div>
<p id="fs-idm78447376">After reading the chapter you might think the current unemployment conundrum may be due to structural unemployment. Indeed, there is a mismatch between the skills employers are seeking and the skills the unemployed possess. But Peter Cappelli has a slightly different view on this&#8212;it is called the purple squirrel. The what?</p>
<p id="fs-idm79379104">In human resource parlance, a purple squirrel is a job candidate who is a perfect fit for all of the many different responsibilities of a position. A purple squirrel candidate could step into a multi-faceted position with no training and permit the firm to higher fewer people because the worker is so versatile. During the Great Recession, Human Resources (HR) positions were reduced. This means today&#8217;s hiring managers are drafting job descriptions and requirements without much, if any HR feedback. &#8220;It turns out it's typically the case that employers' requirements are crazy, they're not paying enough, or their applicant screening is so rigid that nobody gets through,&#8221; Cappelli stated in a 2012 Knowledge@Wharton interview about the findings in his book, <em data-effect="italics">Why Good People Can&#8217;t Find Jobs: Chasing After the Purple Squirrel</em>. In short, managers are searching for &#8220;purple squirrels&#8221; when what they really need are just versatile workers. There really is not a shortage of &#8220;normal squirrels&#8221;&#8212;candidates who are versatile workers. The managers just cannot find them because their requirements, screening processes, and compensation will filter out all but the &#8220;purple&#8221; ones.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12698960" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
  <p id="fs-idp30751216">The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that would be caused by the economic, social, and political forces in the economy even when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the frictional unemployment that occurs when people are put out of work for a time by the shifts of a dynamic and changing economy and any laws concerning conditions of hiring and firing have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation. They also include structural unemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.</p>

<p id="fs-idp18477360">If you were born within the last three decades in the United States, Canada, or many other countries in the developed world, you probably have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when most prices in an entire economy are rising. But there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November of 2008, Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual rate of inflation of 1.6%.</p><p id="fs-idp21360672">Zimbabwe&#8217;s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend. So, let&#8217;s put it into context. It is equivalent to price increases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an economy afflicted with hyperinflation? Not like anything you are familiar with. Prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars were adjusted several times <em data-effect="italics">each day</em>. There was no desire to hold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any cash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers were paid in the trillions a month; however this was equivalent to only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.</p>

<p id="fs-idp9291536">Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than raising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to shortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed foreign currencies to be used for purchases.</p>

<p id="fs-idm39953168">How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function at the most basic level? Before we consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation, let&#8217;s first look at inflation itself.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp65678752" class="note economics chapter-objectives"><div data-type="title" class="title">Introduction to Inflation</div>
<p id="fs-idp52194368">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul id="fs-idp67197632">
<li>Tracking Inflation</li>
<li>How Changes in the Cost of Living are Measured</li>

<p id="fs-idm98746960"><span data-type="term">Inflation</span> is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but the price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in most markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time events, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in prices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped&#8212;well, then it would not be inflation any more.</p>















<p id="fs-idp61428112">This chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of overall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a parenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much of, say, the rise in GDP over different periods of time can be attributed to an actual increase in the production of goods and services and how much should be attributed to the fact that prices for most things have risen.</p>















<p id="fs-idm75969568">Inflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some imperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that will be discussed in other chapters.</p>

 <p id="fs-idp43764400">Dinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when &#8220;everything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.&#8221; <a href="#Table_22_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> compares some prices of common goods in 1970 and 2014. Of course, the average prices shown in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2014, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear, computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in <a href="#Table_22_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>&#8212;and all the price increases for the other products in the economy&#8212;is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. In 2014, $1 had about the same purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 18 cents did in 1972, because of the amount of inflation that has occurred over that time period.</p><table id="Table_22_01" summary="This table has three columns and eight rows.

Not likely.</p><p id="fs-idm2572656">A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price be boiled down to a single inflation rate? As with many problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Prices of a variety of goods and services are combined into a single price level; the inflation rate is simply the percentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm64511296"><h1 data-type="title">The Price of a Basket of Goods</h1>
<p id="fs-idm13148656">To calculate the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">price level</span>, economists begin with the concept of a <span data-type="term">basket of goods and services</span>, consisting of the different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.</p>

<p id="fs-idp42215888">Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based on a few products.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm39264272" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Calculating an Annual Rate of Inflation</div>
<p id="fs-idm41668160">Consider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in <a href="#Table_22_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Say that in any given month, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. Prices for these items over four years are given in the table through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. Each year, the cost of buying the given basket of goods at the prices prevailing at that time is shown.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp22638768"><h1 data-type="title">Index Numbers</h1>
<p id="fs-idp69175024">The numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in <a href="#Table_22_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products was much longer, and more realistic prices were used, the total quantity spent over a year might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.</p>

<p id="fs-idp4363376">To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods, the price level in each period is typically reported as an <span data-type="term">index number</span>, rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods. Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the <span data-type="term">base year</span>, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices. The base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example above, say that time period 3 is chosen as the base year. Since the total amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Mathematically, that is equivalent to dividing $107 by 100, or $1.07. Doing either will give us an index in the base year of 100. Again, this is because the index number in the base year <em data-effect="italics">always</em> has to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.</p>

<p id="fs-idm9444912">Calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example presented in <a href="#Table_22_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are shown in <a href="#Table_22_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Because the index numbers are calculated so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the basket of goods, the inflation rate can be calculated based on the index numbers, using the percentage change formula. So, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be</p>

<p id="fs-idm29122128">If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the index numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that the price levels were expressed in absolute dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and $20,009.32. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about 3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous example. If you&#8217;re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn&#8217;t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm58867184" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Why do you not just subtract index numbers?</div>
<p id="fs-idm37037488">A word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not <em data-effect="italics">exactly</em> 3%. Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-change calculation. The precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 is calculated as (110 &#8211; 107) / 107 = 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible shortcut to calculating the inflation rate&#8212;but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the right answer.</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idp41119120">Two final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them. Although index numbers can be used to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions found in other data. They transform the other data so that the data are easier to work with.</p>

<p id="fs-idm10833264">Second, the choice of a base year for the index number&#8212;that is, the year that is automatically set equal to 100&#8212;is arbitrary. It is chosen as a starting point from which changes in prices are tracked. In the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100 is relatively close to the present. But any base year that is chosen for the index numbers will result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1, when total spending was $100, was also chosen as the base year, and given an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, the inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%, and so on.</p>

<p id="fs-idp6798400">The price level is measured by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost of buying that basket of goods will increase over time. The price level is often expressed in terms of index numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers in the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100. The rate of inflation is measured as the percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.</p>

<p id="fs-idp580496">The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the <span data-type="term">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</span>. The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four. In recent years, the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">cost of living</span>, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.</p>















<p id="fs-idm35113152">To understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held constant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation calculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.</p>















<p id="fs-idp10730480">When the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead. Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes&#8212;not a very likely assumption. Thus, <span data-type="term">substitution bias</span>&#8212;the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time&#8212;tends to overstate the rise in a consumer&#8217;s true cost of living, because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.</p>















<p id="fs-idp13624272">The other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals&#8212;and also if a box of the cereal costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price is being charged for a product of higher (or at least different) quality. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for the computation of the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for quality changes.</p>

Consider how these prices compare to today&#8217;s models. Is the product today of a different quality?</p>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp19633088" data-alt="QR Code representing a URL">
<img src="../resources/54d5a93d795f6df6838cbbd275f2a0fb741e5894" data-media-type="image/png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130"></img>
</span>
</div><p id="fs-idp19744">A new product can be thought of as an extreme improvement in quality&#8212;from something that did not exist to something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods and services used in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. But the process takes some time. For example, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late 1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States&#8212;but cell phones were not yet part of the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind.</p>















<p id="fs-idp27216448">The arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, the <span data-type="term">quality/new goods bias</span> means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer&#8217;s true cost of living, because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated.</p>















<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp26764304" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?</div>
<p id="fs-idm87272640">When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. This is done by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending habits. Consumer expenditures are broken up into eight major groups, shown below, which in turn are broken up into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982&#8211;1984 as the base period.</p>

<p id="fs-idm11185248">For each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the prices of those examples. So, in figuring out the &#8220;breakfast cereal&#8221; item under the overall category of &#8220;foods and beverages,&#8221; the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The specific products and sizes and stores chosen are statistically selected to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-item categories. About one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products are rotated out of the sample each year, and replaced with a different set of products.</p>

<p id="fs-idp74521152">The next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. A survey of 50,000 landlords or tenants is also carried out to collect information about rents.</p>

<p id="fs-idp102712928">The Consumer Price Index is then calculated by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them, using weights (as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C22_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so overall items. Then, the price indices for the 200 items are combined into an overall Consumer Price Index. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories used by data collectors:</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="eip-298"><h1 data-type="title">The CPI and Core Inflation Index           </h1><p id="eip-162">
Imagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck&#8217;s operating condition.  However, the manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck&#8217;s on-time performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the company manager would be paying attention to the production of the firm, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted you, but did not affect the company&#8217;s bottom line.
</p><p id="eip-68">In a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we&#8217;ve learned, CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending. Well, a <span data-type="term">core inflation index</span> is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living. </p><p id="eip-718">Examples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation&#8217;s gasoline was nearly knocked out.  Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in some places up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decisions on interest rates would not be influenced.  Similarly, droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation&#8217;s economic capability.
</p><p id="eip-962">As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, &#8220;It provide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level.&#8221; Bernanke also noted that it helps communicate that every inflationary shock need not be responded to by the Federal Reserve since some price changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy. </p><p id="eip-85">In sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.

</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm9663136"><h1 data-type="title">Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases</h1>
<p id="fs-idp37950304">By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow for some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently, so that new and improved goods could be included more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other characteristics of the product, and then calculate the change in price after these product changes are taken into account. But these adjustments are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional economists.</p><p id="fs-idm43756096">By the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much; over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.</p>
<p id="fs-idm90526976">When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and interpretation. If the inflation rate is calculated with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the calculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate grow more complex.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp39277728"><h1 data-type="title">Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More</h1>
<p id="fs-idp19290336">The basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone&#8217;s personal experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about inflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or Hispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer may not feel quite right.</p>

<p id="fs-idm42100656">This problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or housing.</p>

<p id="fs-idm31133936">The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example, the <span data-type="term">Producer Price Index (PPI)</span> is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services. It can be broken down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of processing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, crude materials for further processing, and so on). There is an <span data-type="term">International Price Index</span> based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An <span data-type="term">Employment Cost Index</span> measures wage inflation in the labor market. The <span data-type="term">GDP deflator</span>, measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a price index that includes all the components of GDP (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year&#8217;s GDP would have been worth using the base-year&#8217;s prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: data are collected online from retailers and then composed into an index that is compared to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).</p><p id="fs-idm9477792">What&#8217;s the best measure of inflation? If concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good measure of cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example, aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products purchased by households. That is why the CPI is sometimes referred to as the cost-of-living index. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: &#8220;The &#8216;best&#8217; measure of inflation for a given application depends on the intended use of the data.&#8221;</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp43096720" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm21266848">Measuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by which a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what is relatively less expensive and less of what is relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket cannot take into account improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These problems can be reduced in degree&#8212;for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time&#8212;but they cannot be totally eliminated. The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of goods representing what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by excluding volatile economic variables. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods. The GDP deflator is based on all the components of GDP. The Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and inputs bought by producers of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idm28618784">Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services purchased by the typical urban consumer, it measures the prices of things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI would be the best price index to use for this purpose.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idp35986432">The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation&#8212;called <span data-type="term">deflation</span>&#8212;in the early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep recession of 1920&#8211;21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases.) For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.</p>

</div><p id="fs-idp33433360">Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of 1920&#8211;1921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980&#8211;1982, and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Recession</span> in 2008&#8211;2009. There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. Recessions are typically accompanied by higher levels of unemployment, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, developed in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.</p>

<p id="fs-idm22787280">Around the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed, as can be seen in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C22_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> which shows inflation rates over the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high inflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan&#8217;s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have largely stayed down.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idp41873792">Countries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low rates of measured inflation&#8212;because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although the statistics for these economies should be regarded as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced <span data-type="term">hyperinflation</span>&#8212;an outburst of high inflation&#8212;of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia&#8217;s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C22_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

</figure><p id="fs-idm60395488">Many countries in Latin America experienced raging hyperinflation during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation rates often well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in 1995.</p>

<p id="fs-idp30598128">In the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent years, the world&#8217;s worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)&#8212;that is, the bills had $100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.</p>

 <p id="fs-idp22159216">Economists usually oppose high inflation, but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Robert Shiller</span>, one of 2013&#8217;s Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked, &#8220;Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools?&#8221; Answers were on a scale of 1&#8211;5, where 1 meant &#8220;Fully agree&#8221; and 5 meant &#8220;Completely disagree.&#8221; For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered &#8220;Fully agree&#8221; that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4% said &#8220;Completely disagree.&#8221; However, among professional economists, only 18% answered &#8220;Fully agree,&#8221; while the same percentage of 18% answered &#8220;Completely disagree.&#8221;</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp1489280"><h1 data-type="title">The Land of Funny Money</h1>
<p id="fs-idp66412736">What are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public? Consider a very short story: &#8220;<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">The Land of Funny Money</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p id="fs-idm45180208">One morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny Money. But the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone&#8217;s pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone&#8217;s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices ended up not mattering much at all.</p>

<p id="fs-idp3948976">When the people in Robert Shiller&#8217;s surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.</p>

<p id="fs-idm59272000">Economists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">wages</span>, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people&#8217;s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of Funny Money, then no one&#8217;s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">redistributions</span> of purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp32054656"><h1 data-type="title">Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power</h1>
<p id="fs-idp54798112">Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation include those who are holding a lot of cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash is diminished. But cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.</p>

<p id="fs-idm119271808">The problem of a good-looking <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">nominal interest rate</span> being transformed into an ugly-looking <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real interest rate</span> can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an adjustment for inflation. So, a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest is taxed on the $500 received&#8212;no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. But if inflation is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain&#8212;but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is <em data-effect="italics">negative</em> 5% and the person is actually falling behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.</p>

<p id="fs-idm35008">Inflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time eventually. The last row of <a href="/contents/2f9defed-a28f-48b0-b7b2-6316433b4ded@2#Table_22_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> at the start of this chapter showed that average hourly wage in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $19.55 in 2014, which is an increase by a factor of almost six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">minimum wage</span> is adjusted for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C22_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C22_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation </div><figcaption>After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse&#8212;as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm; http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu)</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp7419424" data-alt="The graph shows that nominal minimum wages have increase substantially since the 1970s. However, with the inflation adjustment, the minimum wage has actually decreased in comparison to the 1970s.">

</span>

</figure>

<p id="fs-idm59821408">One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">pensions</span> have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, pensions are called &#8220;defined benefits&#8221; plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.</p>

<p id="fs-idm34560480">Fortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by &#8220;defined contribution&#8221; plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount to the worker&#8217;s retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">401(k)</span> comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.</p><p id="fs-idm96707040">However, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then the loan must be repaid at a real interest rate of 6%. But if inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower&#8217;s benefit from inflation is the lender&#8217;s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who end up being repaid in dollars that are worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.</p>

<p id="fs-idm69758768">The unintended redistributions of buying power caused by inflation may have a broader effect on society. America&#8217;s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people&#8217;s actions have a reasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that inflation is so disliked by the general public is a sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary&#8212;and therefore likely to be perceived as unfair &#8211; even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm23616080" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler&#8217;s rise to power?</div>
<p id="fs-idm5795024">Germany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler could take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:</p>

<p id="fs-idp63533328"></p><blockquote id="fs-idp54525168">A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark&#8217;s inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 &#215; 10<sup>28</sup>%), came in the same month as did Hitler&#8217;s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party&#8217;s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed putsch resulted in Hitler&#8217;s imprisonment, at which time he wrote his book <em data-effect="italics">Mein Kampf</em>, setting forth an inspirational plan for Germany&#8217;s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .</blockquote>

<blockquote id="fs-idm30524896">. . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to it may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . [the putsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.</blockquote>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm90768"><h1 data-type="title">Blurred Price Signals</h1>
<p id="fs-idp17540928">Prices are the messengers in a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">market economy</span>, conveying information about conditions of demand and supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that price signals are perceived more vaguely, like a radio program received with a lot of static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.</p>

<p id="fs-idp6163680">In Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some extent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic hint to start substituting other products&#8212;or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production&#8212;or is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will presumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?</p>

<p id="fs-idp133680">High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">surpluses</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">shortages</span>.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm43656592"><h1 data-type="title">Problems of Long-Term Planning</h1>
<p id="fs-idm65491280">Inflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">redistributions</span>, we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation cannot be known with certainty.</p>

<p id="fs-idm63325152">Inflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can make money from inflation&#8212;for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see the value of that cash eroded by inflation. But when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.</p>

<p id="fs-idp25730624">In the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation&#8217;s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20&#8211;30% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s&#8212;to 10%&#8212;U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C22_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm36650480"><h1 data-type="title">Any Benefits of Inflation?</h1>
<p id="fs-idm12532368">Although the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting. First, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe recessions.</p>

<p id="fs-idm63337600">Second, an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">labor markets</span> more flexible. The discussion in <a href="/contents/411630a6-6de7-44a1-a937-9c6f0f2341e8@2" class="target-chapter">Unemployment</a> pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages, and thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act as sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor market. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to take all the effects of inflation into account. It does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be especially harmful.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm37387888" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm94659936">Unexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments, does not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that can be paid in less valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning. High rates of inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and can vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.</p>

 <p id="fs-idm44831040">When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, it is said to be <span data-type="term">indexed</span>. An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">private markets</span> and government programs. Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another&#8212;say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive&#8212;indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp17265568"><h1 data-type="title">Indexing in Private Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idp44842384">In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had <span data-type="term">cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)</span> which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to wages.</p>

<p id="fs-idm26882048">Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An <span data-type="term">adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</span> is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate can be correspondingly lower.</p>

<p id="fs-idp8705712">A number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will be adjusted automatically according to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if inflation turns out higher than expected; buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high buying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for inflation in effect agrees on a real price to be paid, rather than a nominal price.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm40555904"><h1 data-type="title">Indexing in Government Programs</h1>
<p id="fs-idm31145280">Many government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person&#8217;s income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well; this is what is meant by the expression &#8220;move into a higher tax bracket.&#8221; For example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2014 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to $9,075; 15% of all income from $9,076 to $36,900; 25% of all taxable income from $36,901 to $89,350; 28% of all taxable income from $89,351 to $186,350; 33% of all taxable income from $186,351 to $405,100; 35% of all taxable income from $405,101 to $406,750; and 39.6% of all income from $406,751 and above.</p><p id="fs-idp12808160">Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, the taxes owed by any individual cannot be exactly determined based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though their real income had not risen. This &#8220;bracket creep,&#8221; as it was called, was eliminated by law in 1981. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.</p>

<p id="fs-idp47411360">The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Social Security Indexing Act of 1972</span>, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount&#8212;$117,000 in 2014. This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base.</p><p id="fs-idm7627072">As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began offering indexed <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">bonds</span>. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated dollars at a lower real interest rate. But indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation&#8212;no matter the level of inflation&#8212;can be a very comforting investment.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm6030352"><h1 data-type="title">Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp955728">Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of inflation.</p>

<p id="fs-idp30553744">However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. But as partial inflation indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it most.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp10062352"><h1 data-type="title">A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation</h1>
<p id="fs-idp72620080">This chapter has focused on how inflation is measured, historical experience with inflation, how to adjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. The causes of inflation have barely been hinted at, and government policies to deal with inflation have not been addressed at all. These issues will be taken up in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.</p>

<p id="fs-idm42998496">The cause of inflation can be summed up in one sentence: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges of inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very high, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also commonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying power surges forth, driving up inflation. On the other hand, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then inflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, slowdowns in economic activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, are typically associated with a reduction in inflation or even outright deflation.</p>

<p id="fs-idm37012032">The policy implications are clear. If inflation is to be avoided, the amount of purchasing power in the economy must grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government can use to affect the amount of purchasing power&#8212;through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates and credit&#8212;can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm56178624" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?</div>
<p id="fs-idm115248656">As we will learn in <a href="/contents/d293069d-90f9-4fdc-a303-7111f235f13d@3" class="target-chapter">Money and Banking</a>, the existence of money provides enormous benefits to an economy. In a real sense, money is the lubrication that enhances the workings of markets. Money makes transactions easier. It allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the money earned to purchase the other products they need to live on. However, too much money in circulation can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy reverts to barter, or it adopts another country&#8217;s more stable currency, like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.</p><p id="fs-idm575584">Only national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation. Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The only option is to print money&#8212;more and more of it. With more money in circulation chasing the same amount (or even less) goods and services, the only result is higher and higher prices until the economy and/or the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of letting inflation get out of control.</p>

<p id="fs-idm43814032">A payment is said to be indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector include wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security payments.</p>

<p id="fs-idp14270896">How much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think not much? Think again. Suppose you take out a student loan, or you deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings and borrowing. Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts &#8220;made in China,&#8221; and later contribute to a charity that helps refugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an IRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas. While your involvement may not seem as influential as someone like the president, who can increase or decrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with the global financial system on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="fs-idp93601488">The balance of payments&#8212;a term you will meet soon&#8212;seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific components of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a trade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of Congo (often referred to as &#8220;Congo&#8221;), a large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In contrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the economy in the United States is doing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not going down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a trade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm29103136">The <span data-type="term">balance of trade</span> (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation&#8217;s dollar value of its exports, or what its producers sell abroad, and a nation&#8217;s dollar worth of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that households and businesses purchase. Recall from <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> that if exports exceed imports, the economy is said to have a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">trade surplus</span>. If imports exceed exports, the economy is said to have a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">trade deficit</span>. If exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced. But what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses or deficits exist?</p><p id="fs-idp86174288">Germany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly exceeded imports. According to the Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s The World Factbook, in 2013, Germany ran a trade surplus of $260 billion. In contrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have considerably exceeded exports. In 2014, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $539 billion.</p><p id="fs-idm53909536">A series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span> often falling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A number of countries in East Asia&#8212;Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia&#8212;came down with the same economic illness in 1997&#8211;1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in goods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?</p>







<p id="fs-idp147920768">We will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in the United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international flows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two sides of the same coin. It is often assumed that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign for an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.</p>

<p id="fs-idp42760480">A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes, trains, and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. This measurement is called the <span data-type="term">merchandise trade balance</span>. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods make up less than half of a country&#8217;s total production, while services compose more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the merchandise trade balance is still announced by the government and reported prominently in the newspapers. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the <span data-type="term">current account balance</span> which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.</p>

<p id="fs-idp122455152">Do not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which includes not just <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exports</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">imports</span>, but also income from investment and transfers.</p>
<p id="fs-idp52166640">Statistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</span> within the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, using a variety of different sources. Importers and exporters of merchandise must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in services&#8212;which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without any physical goods being shipped&#8212;the BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys track investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.</p><p id="fs-idp29093376">This information on international flows of goods and capital is then cross-checked against other available data. For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which can be used to check the data on trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital&#8212;including banks and companies making financial investments like stocks&#8212;must file reports, which are ultimately compiled by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Information on foreign trade can also be cross-checked by looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics cited in this chapter come from these sources.</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idp80239584">The second row of <a href="#Table_23_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">surplus</span>. Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014, compared to one-fifth in 1980.</p><p id="fs-idp98558512">The third component of the current account balance, labeled &#8220;<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">income payments</span>,&#8221; refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.</p>
<p id="fs-idp24177728">The final category of the current account balance is <span data-type="term">unilateral transfers</span>, which are payments made by government, private charities, or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an individual in the United States sends money overseas, it is also counted in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an international coalition against Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.</p><p id="fs-idm19733200">The following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.</p>

<p id="fs-idp199807232">The trade balance measures the gap between a country&#8217;s exports and its imports. In most high-income economies, goods make up less than half of a country&#8217;s total production, while services compose more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services. The current account balance includes the trade in goods, services, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.</p>

<p id="fs-idm101438464">The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in 1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.</p>

  <p id="fs-idm45132096">As economists see it, trade surpluses can be either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade deficits can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of <span data-type="term">financial capital</span>. In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.</p>















































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm68368816"><h1 data-type="title">A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday</h1>
<p id="fs-idm37129328">To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719, was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20955552">Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts. Or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each person&#8217;s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.</p>
<p id="fs-idm3159824">However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.</p>
<p id="fs-idp64410704">This parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The first issue raised by this story of Robinson and Friday is this: Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson&#8217;s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.</p>
<p id="fs-idp25151840">A second issue raised by the parable: What can go wrong? Robinson&#8217;s proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday&#8217;s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether that loan is repaid as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system. Or perhaps Robinson has been too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay Friday as much as previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday and Robinson. Friday&#8217;s attitude toward these renegotiations is likely to be shaped by why the repayment failed. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.</p>
<p id="fs-idp86656064">A third issue raised by the parable of Robinson and Friday is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday&#8217;s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson&#8217;s trade deficit is exactly how much he is borrowing from Friday. Indeed, to economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.</p>
<p id="fs-idm78188384">The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">comparative advantage</span>, which you learn more about in the <a href="/contents/1f4933b1-1d91-4e34-a416-0c0d4608f64a@2" class="target-chapter">International Trade</a> chapter. The following Work It Out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm20203824" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Calculating Comparative Advantage</div>
<p id="fs-idm29876288">In the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. <a href="#Table_23_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the varying hours of labor per unit of output.</p>

<p id="fs-idm25879024">Step 1. Observe from <a href="#Table_23_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.</p>



<p id="fs-idm46613248">Step 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4 versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).</p>

<p id="fs-idp53125984">Step 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so 1/8 of a bushel of wheat can be made in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States, so 1/9 of a yard of cloth can be made in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm64180208"><h1 data-type="title">The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments</h1>
<p id="fs-idm90247216">The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">balance of payments</span>. Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50484064"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C23_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country&#8212;the United States in this example&#8212;and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current account, while flow of funds (lines two and four) are found in the financial account.</p>
<p id="fs-idm57334304">The bottom four lines of the <a href="#CNX_Econ_C23_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the flow of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to rest of the world. Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from rest of the world into the home country and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">investment income</span> (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. The investment income (bottom lines two and four) are found in the current account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) are found in the financial account. Unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account, are not shown in this figure.</p>



<figure id="CNX_Econ_C23_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">Flow of Investment Goods and Capital </div><figcaption>Each element of the current account balance involves a flow of financial payments between countries.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp109061840">A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic investors put their funds abroad, while the deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.</p>
<p id="fs-idp189392512">It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may invest in another country&#8212;by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.</p>

<p id="fs-idp104723200">International flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital. A current account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income together, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus is the opposite and means the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp30191872"><h1 data-type="title">Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance</h1>
<p id="fs-idp88207216">The <span data-type="term">national saving and investment identity</span> provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance. In a nation&#8217;s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial capital market</span>, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.</p>



<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp169574000" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?</div>
<p id="fs-idm4700464">A country&#8217;s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is entering the country and is considered part of the supply of financial capital.</p>
<p id="fs-idp19771680">The demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. So both business investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.</p></div>




<p id="fs-idp81450144">There are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M &#8211; X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S. economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. This national savings and investment identity can be expressed in algebraic terms:</p>

<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm47593936"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Supply&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Demand&#160;for&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S&#160;+&#160;(M&#160;&#8211;&#160;X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I&#160;+&#160;(G&#160;&#8211;&#160;T)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Supply&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Demand&#160;for&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S&#160;+&#160;(M&#160;&#8211;&#160;X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I&#160;+&#160;(G&#160;&#8211;&#160;T)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>


<p id="fs-idp51487664">Again, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.</p>



<p id="fs-idm49020288">However, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G &#8211; T &gt; 0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the right-hand side of the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T &#8211; G &gt; 0), and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.</p>
<p id="fs-idm30182720">Similarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other countries.</p>
<p id="fs-idp39873728">The fundamental notion that total quantity of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial capital</span> demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital. However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm7902880"><h1 data-type="title">Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance</h1>
<p id="fs-idp60300064">One insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation&#8217;s balance of trade is determined by that nation&#8217;s own levels of domestic saving and domestic investment. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and then the situation with a trade surplus.</p>
<p id="fs-idm54904368">In the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:

<p id="fs-idm55658960">In this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.</p>


<p id="fs-idp49837968">Now consider a trade <em data-effect="italics">surplus</em> from the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:

<p id="fs-idp34635936">In this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be invested abroad.</p>
<p id="fs-idp1159200">This connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment identity shows, the trade balance is not determined by the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel. Nor is the trade balance determined by whether the nation&#8217;s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism (see <a href="/contents/1e325274-8f38-40cc-b775-45a1656cbc62@2" class="target-chapter">Globalization and Protectionism</a>).</p></section>

<p id="fs-idm67009616">Now, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors constant.</p>

<p id="fs-idm72356656">As a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged. The result is shown in the first row of <a href="#Table_23_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> under the equation. Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold&#8212;it is, after all, an identity that must be true by definition&#8212;the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial capital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

<p id="fs-idm63644848">As a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment and public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving&#8212;although exactly how to increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.</p>
<p id="fs-idp113768816">As a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986&#8212;an increase in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5 billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 million in 1986&#8212;an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of $152 billion. The two numbers do not match exactly, since in the real world, private savings and investment did not remain fixed. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S. economy&#8217;s demand for financial capital, and that increase was primarily supplied by foreign investors through the trade deficit. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp17740416" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Solving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity</div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm178263456"><h1 data-type="title">Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance</h1>
<p id="fs-idm92331296">In the short run, trade imbalances can be affected by whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing. A recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller.</p>
<p id="fs-idp13491456">As an example, note in <a href="/contents/4121ebac-cf37-4d36-ae1f-bfdb4e08f69d@2#CNX_Econ_C23_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not fall by as much.</p><p id="fs-idm126935488">Conversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was lots of aggressive buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a rapidly growing domestic economy is often accompanied by a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus), while a slowing or recessionary domestic economy is accompanied by a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit).</p>
<p id="fs-idm172129600">When the trade deficit rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">foreign financial capital</span>. The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways. For example, the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad could be offset by reduced private savings, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet another possibility is that the inflow of foreign financial capital could be absorbed by greater government borrowing, leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur&#8212;only that one of them must occur.</p>

If domestic savings increases and nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect, the economy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital. If the government starts borrowing instead of saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government is no longer providing savings and so, if nothing else is to change, more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If the rate of domestic investment surges, then, <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em>, the trade deficit must also rise, to provide the extra capital. The <em data-effect="italics">ceteris paribus</em>&#8212;or &#8220;other things being equal&#8221;&#8212;assumption is important here. In all of these situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the original change will affect only, or primarily, the trade deficit.

<p id="fs-idp22324976">Because flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the same as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much&#8212;as anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify&#8212;borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.</p>







<p id="fs-idm77079472">It makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education, because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as the money is wisely invested in ways that will tend to raise the nation&#8217;s economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.</p>







<p id="fs-idp39246496">One vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital was, by and large, invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See the following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)</p>







<p id="fs-idm98101968">A more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s&#8212;and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses&#8212;that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending capital abroad.</p>







<p id="fs-idm9656224">In contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can find itself in a bind if the incoming funds from abroad are not invested in a way that leads to increased productivity. Several of the large economies of Latin America, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.</p>























<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp67624720" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Are trade deficits always harmful?</div>
<p id="fs-idp126366016">For most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all; instead, the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">per capita GDP</span> in the world by around 1900.</p>
<p id="fs-idp56460672">The U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment&#8212;railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools&#8212;which were important to helping the growth of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20640992">The effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth should not be overstated. In most years the foreign financial capital represented no more than 6&#8211;10% of the funds used for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.</p></div>































<p id="fs-idm101260976">A second &#8220;trouble&#8221; is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? This scenario was raised at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia&#8212;Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea&#8212;ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in <a href="/contents/e97892bf-8113-45f9-892e-107d9adec52f@4" class="target-chapter">The Impacts of Government Borrowing</a>.</p><p id="fs-idm44919456">While a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan&#8217;s trade surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp242806608" class="note economics linkup">

<p id="fs-idm55384992">The sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a legitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international capital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997&#8211;1998. Even an economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly be paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and foreign borrowing has gone badly&#8212;if only as a cautionary tale.</p>































<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp84358176" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.</div>
<p id="fs-idp90499168">Perhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan&#8217;s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, its large trade surpluses were often described, especially by non-economists, as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health. But from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan&#8217;s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990, with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span> growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.</p>
<p id="fs-idp40410640">Instead, Japan&#8217;s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest domestically, and so the extra funds are invested abroad. In Japan&#8217;s slow economy, the growth of consumption is relatively low, which also means that consumption of imports is relatively low. Thus, Japan&#8217;s exports continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan&#8217;s trade surpluses began to deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idp115332000">Trade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic weakness. Either trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether the corresponding flows of financial capital are wisely invested.</p>

In a recession, demand for all goods, including imports, has declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not necessarily altered much, so the result is a larger trade surplus.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm30303168">A nation&#8217;s <em data-effect="italics">level</em> of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the <em data-effect="italics">balance</em> of trade, but these two are actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">level of trade</span>&#8212;measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP&#8212;while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation&#8217;s production is exported. It is also possible for a country&#8217;s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. This general theme was emphasized earlier in <a href="/contents/d13ac99a-404f-4400-95ba-5df0cdaafeb4@2">Measuring Trade Balances</a>, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.</p><p id="fs-idp33673552">A country&#8217;s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. This is measured by the percent of exports out of GDP. It indicates how globalized an economy is. Some countries, such as Germany, have a high level of trade&#8212;they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For example, the United States only exports 14% of GDP, but it has a trade deficit of $540 billion.)</p><p id="fs-idm41128176">Three factors strongly influence a nation&#8217;s level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade, while others do not.</p>







<p id="fs-idp92440384">Consequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade. Whereas, the United States and Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world average.</p>







<p id="fs-idm13569616">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">balance of trade</span> is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus in 2008, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a large trade surplus in 2007, while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.</p>







<p id="fs-idp6333168">In short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.</p>























<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm158149456" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.</div>
<p id="fs-idm75163584">India was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century&#8212;which was not true.</p>
<p id="fs-idm41799872">Instead, India&#8217;s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to Great Britain. In India, this flow of financial capital was heavily criticized as the &#8220;drain,&#8221; and eliminating the drain of financial capital was viewed as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving independence.</p></div>















































<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm136851296"><h1 data-type="title">Final Thoughts about Trade Balances</h1>
<p id="fs-idm131020400">Trade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of zero&#8212;which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the international economy&#8212;can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation&#8217;s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.</p>
<p id="fs-idm77466272">It is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If a trade deficit was called &#8220;attracting foreign financial capital&#8221;&#8212;which accurately describes what a trade deficit means&#8212;then trade deficits might look more attractive. Conversely, if a trade surplus were called &#8220;shipping financial capital abroad&#8221;&#8212;which accurately captures what a trade surplus does&#8212;then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk reactions to terms like &#8220;trade surplus,&#8221; &#8220;trade balance,&#8221; and &#8220;trade deficit.&#8221;</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm103286864" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">More than Meets the Eye in the Congo</div>
<p id="fs-idm3788912">Now that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.</p>
<p id="fs-idm39514704">You now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is doing well or not. The Democratic Republic of Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance was &#8211;$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt&#8212;and that is a good thing.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm119678800" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm73196240">There is a difference between the level of a country&#8217;s trade and the balance of trade. The level of trade is measured by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have nearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower levels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country&#8217;s history of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country&#8217;s balance of trade is the dollar difference between its exports and imports.</p>
<p id="fs-idm5729552">Trade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad&#8212;it depends on the circumstances. Even if a country is borrowing, if that money is invested in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an improvement in long-term economic growth.</p>

<ol id="fs-idm29241392" data-number-style="lower-alpha">
<li>A large economy tends to have lower levels of international trade, because it can do more of its trade internally, but this has little impact on its trade imbalance.</li>
<li>An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic saving (including government and private saving) will always lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level of trade.</li>
<li>Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the level of trade, but has little impact one way or the other on a trade imbalance.</li>
<li>The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget deficit means a large demand for financial capital which, according to the national saving and investment identity, makes it somewhat more likely that there will be a need for an inflow of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.</li>
<li>A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the level of trade. However, it does not necessarily say much about the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports and exports, and by national levels of physical investment and savings.</li>

<p id="ch24mod00_p02">The United States experienced rising home ownership rates for most of the last two decades. Between 1990 and 2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and 2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was considered to be a safe financial investment. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how new single family home sales peaked in 2005 at 107,000 units.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_017"><div data-type="title" class="title">New Single Family Houses Sold</div><figcaption>From the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of new single family houses sold rose steadily.

</span>

</figure><p id="ch24mod00_p03">The housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as delinquency and late payments began to grow and an oversupply of new homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to a decrease in the overall wealth of the household sector and caused homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage lenders were forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their payments, and by 2008 the problem had spread throughout the financial markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble burst. Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even extend credit to credit-worthy customers.</p><p id="ch24mod00_p04">The housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major contributors to the Great Recession that led to unemployment rates over 10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from the impact of the Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in restoring financial market stability through the implementation of aggressive fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p id="ch24mod00_p05">The economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with recessions and expansions. Some of these fluctuations are severe, such as the economic downturn experienced during Great Depression of the 1930&#8217;s which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at different rates in different years? What are the causes of the cyclical behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model, the aggregate demand&#8211;aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding of why economies expand and contract over time.</p>

<p id="ch24mod00_p06">A key part of macroeconomics is the use of models to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation</span> seem to move in opposite directions: lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000, higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s, and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the current account deficit rise so high, but then decline in 2009?</p>







<p id="ch24mod00_p07">To analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate supply</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span>, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals. The chapter on <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@3" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a> focuses on the macroeconomy in the short run, where aggregate demand plays a crucial role.

<p id="ch24mod01_p01">Macroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups: those who argue that supply is the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along, and those who argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags along.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod01_01"><h1 data-type="title">Say&#8217;s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply</h1>
<p id="ch24mod01_p02">Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Jean-Baptiste Say</span> (1767&#8211;1832). <span data-type="term">Say&#8217;s law</span> is: &#8220;Supply creates its own demand.&#8221; As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view.</p><p id="ch24mod01_p03">The intuition behind Say&#8217;s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone, and so, Say&#8217;s law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Adam Smith</span>, and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as &#8220;classical&#8221; economists, modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say&#8217;s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called <span data-type="term">neoclassical economists</span>.</p><p id="ch24mod01_p04">If <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">supply</span> always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span> is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.</p><p id="ch24mod01_p05">Say&#8217;s law that supply creates its own <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand</span> does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their products.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod01_02"><h1 data-type="title">Keynes&#8217; Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand</h1>
<p id="ch24mod01_p06">The alternative to Say&#8217;s law, with its emphasis on supply, can be named <span data-type="term">Keynes&#8217; law</span>: &#8220;Demand creates its own supply.&#8221; As a matter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say&#8217;s law, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">John Maynard Keynes</span> never wrote down Keynes&#8217; law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view.</p><p id="ch24mod01_p07">When Keynes wrote his great work <em data-effect="italics">The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</em> during the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Depression</span> of the 1930s, he pointed out that during the Depression, the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories were closed and shuttered, but machinery and equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression&#8212;and many ordinary recessions as well&#8212;were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the amount of total demand.</p><p id="ch24mod01_p08">Keynes&#8217; law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the government spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component. Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity of labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not disappear just because of an increase in demand.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod01_03"><h1 data-type="title">Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics</h1>
<p id="ch24mod01_p09">Two insights emerge from this overview of Say&#8217;s law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes&#8217; law with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash, is that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial success. Both supply and demand need to be taken into account. The second conclusion is that since Keynes&#8217; law applies more accurately in the short run and Say&#8217;s law applies more accurately in the long run, the tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and the long run.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod01_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch24mod01_p10">Neoclassical economists emphasize Say&#8217;s law, which holds that supply creates its own demand. Keynesian economists emphasize Keynes&#8217; law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.</p></section>

<p id="ch24mod02_p01">To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level. This model is called the <span data-type="term">aggregate demand/aggregate supply model</span>. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod02_01"><h1 data-type="title">The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP</h1>
<p id="ch24mod02_p02">Firms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. Profits, in turn, are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, the firm needs to buy. <span data-type="term">Aggregate supply (AS)</span> refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell. The <span data-type="term">aggregate supply (AS) curve</span> shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and sell at each price level.</p><p id="ch24mod02_p03"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.</p>
    <figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Aggregate Supply Curve</div><figcaption>Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more and to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C24_001" data-alt="The graph shows an upward sloping aggregate supply curve. The slope is gradual between 6,500 and 9,000 before become steeper, especially between 9,500 and 9,900.">
    <img src="../resources/ef2a42cfa1d2568c0c9f88eb70c35e6499f3d595" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The graph shows an upward sloping aggregate supply curve. The slope is gradual between 6,500 and 9,000 before become steeper, especially between 9,500 and 9,900."></img>
    </span>

    </figure>
<p id="ch24mod02_p04">The horizontal axis of the diagram shows real GDP&#8212;that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an index number, like the GDP deflator, while the inflation rate is the percentage change between price levels over time.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p05">As the price level (the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy) rises, the aggregate quantity of goods and services supplied rises as well. Why? The price level shown on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or outputs bought in the economy&#8212;like the GDP deflator&#8212;not the price level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production.</p><p id="ch24mod02_p06">The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below <span data-type="term">potential GDP</span>, which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell&#8212;while making the assumption of no rise in input prices&#8212;can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.</p><p id="ch24mod02_p07">As the quantity produced increases, however, certain firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the intermediate area of the AS curve, a higher price level for outputs continues to encourage a greater quantity of output&#8212;but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in quantity in response to a given rise in the price level will not be quite as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod02_clear01" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Why does AS cross potential GDP?</div>
<p id="ch24mod02_p08">The aggregate supply curve is typically drawn to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its &#8220;potential&#8221; or &#8220;full employment&#8221; GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is indeed possible for production to sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.</p>
</div>
<p id="ch24mod02_p09">At the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low&#8212;at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called <span data-type="term">full-employment GDP</span>.</p>

This distinction will be further explained in the appendix <a href="/contents/82baa7dd-7876-4724-a4f7-2bb756395725@2">The Expenditure-Output Model</a>. For now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the price level&#8212;recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy. The <span data-type="term">aggregate demand (AD) curve</span> shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level.</p><p id="ch24mod02_p11"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The following components make up aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X &#8211; M.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Aggregate Demand Curve</div><figcaption>Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.</figcaption>

<p id="ch24mod02_p12">The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the price level reduces people&#8217;s wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p13">The interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by households for homes and cars&#8212;thus reducing consumption and investment spending.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p14">The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world. U.S. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exports</span> will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">imports</span> from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level, relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p15">Truth be told, among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> slopes downward fairly steeply; the steep slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not very large.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod02_03"><h1 data-type="title">Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</h1><p id="ch24mod02_p19">The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a high quantity. As the price level for outputs rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p20"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> combines the AS curve from <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and the AD curve from <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and places them both on a single diagram.

<p id="ch24mod02_p21">Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod02_clear02" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Are AS and AD macro or micro?</div>
<p id="ch24mod02_p22">These aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying differences.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p23">For example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared with the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast, the vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator&#8212;combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a specific market.</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p24">In addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram (although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the AS curve).</p>
<p id="ch24mod02_p25">In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.</p></div>

In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential.  In the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP.  For this reason, what we have been calling the AS curve, will from this point on may also be referred to as the <span data-type="term">short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve</span>. The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the <span data-type="term">long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve</span>.

<p id="ch24mod02_p26">The upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the price level and the level of real GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the price level for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits encourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on the right. In the long run, aggregate supply is shown by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which is the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of
workers, physical capital, technology, and economic institutions.</p><p id="ch24mod02_p27">The downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for outputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the wealth effect, which means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b) the interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will tend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign price effect, which holds that a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and encouraging imports.</p>

<p id="ch24mod03_p01">The original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts. When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, a greater quantity of real GDP is produced. When the SRAS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, a lower quantity of real GDP is produced. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve: productivity growth and input prices.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod03_01"><h1 data-type="title">How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve</h1>
<p id="ch24mod03_p02">In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">productivity growth</span>. Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP per capita</span>. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output. Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub> to SRAS<sub>2</sub>, reflecting the rise in potential GDP in this economy, and the equilibrium shifts from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">Shifts in Aggregate Supply</div><figcaption>(a) The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> is at the intersection of AD and SRAS<sub>0</sub>. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> is at the intersection of AD and SRAS<sub>1</sub>, and then yet another equilibrium, E<sub>2</sub>, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS<sub>2</sub>. Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower quantity will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to AS<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium, E<sub>1</sub>, has a reduced quantity of output and a higher price level than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C24_013" data-alt="The two graphs show how aggregate supply can shift and how these shifts affect points of equilibrium. The graph on the left shows how productivity increases will shift aggregate supply to the right. The graph on the right shows how higher prices for key inputs will shift aggregate supply to the left.">

</span>

</figure><p id="ch24mod03_p03">A shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which are typically measured in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod_02"><h1 data-type="title">How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve</h1>
<p id="ch24mod03_p04">Higher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include wages and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, causing the equilibrium to move from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>. The movement from the original equilibrium of E<sub>0</sub> to the new equilibrium of E<sub>1</sub> will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974&#8211;1975, 1980&#8211;1982, 1990&#8211;91, 2001, and 2007&#8211;2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed <span data-type="term">stagflation</span>.</p><p id="ch24mod03_p05">Conversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting price of oil led to a situation like that presented earlier in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.</p><p id="ch24mod03_p06">Along with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported goods that are used as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod03_03"><h1 data-type="title">Other Supply Shocks</h1>
<p id="ch24mod03_p07">The aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.</p>
<p id="ch24mod03_p08">Similarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their country. In this case, aggregate supply would shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to produce goods at any given price.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod03_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch24mod03_p09">The aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact. The intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or AD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the right as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to the right if the price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output, higher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the right, a combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.</p></section>

<p id="ch24mod04_p01">As mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level. <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@3" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a> will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift: changes in the behavior of consumers or firms and changes in government tax or spending policy.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod04_clear01" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Do imports diminish aggregate demand?</div>
<p id="ch24mod04_p02">We have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand?</p><p id="eip-976">When an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. So the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country; it would be wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.</p><p id="ch24mod04_p03">Because of the way in which the demand equation is written, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.</p></div>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod04_01"><h1 data-type="title">How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD</h1>
<p id="ch24mod04_p04">When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">business confidence</span> is high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and investment spending decline.</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p05">The University of Michigan publishes a survey of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">consumer confidence</span> and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/">http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu</a>, which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the low 80s, which is considered close to being considered a healthy state.</p><p id="ch24mod04_p06">One measure of business confidence is published by the OECD: the "business tendency surveys". Business opinion survey data are collected for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment, among other elements of the business climate. After sharply declining during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the past. </p><p id="ch24mod04_p08">Because a rise in confidence is associated with higher consumption and investment demand, it will lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a).</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p09">Consumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that the president warned against in the first place. A shift of AD to the left, and the corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price level, is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b).</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod04_02"><h1 data-type="title">How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD</h1>
<p id="ch24mod04_p10">Government spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion.</p><p id="ch24mod04_p11">Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand, while <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">tax</span> increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p12">During a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span>, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses, the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the recession of 2001, for example, a tax cut was enacted into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people going through hard times need relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E<sub>0</sub>, relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the right. At the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model</div><figcaption>Whether the economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical LRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y<sub>0</sub> at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of output Y<sub>1</sub> at the equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C24_008" data-alt="The graph shows an example of an aggregate demand shift.

</figure><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod04_clear02" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Do economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?</div>
<p id="ch24mod04_p13">One of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: &#8220;Read my lips! No new taxes!&#8221; In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and Bush succeeded in pushing a package of tax cuts through Congress early in 2001. Disputes over tax cuts often ignite at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p14">What side are economists on? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether the tax cuts are accompanied by equally large government spending cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be and what programs might be cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close the economy is to the full employment level of output. In a recession, when the intersection of the AD and AS curves is far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already doing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p15">With the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, which took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and the Obama tax cuts of 2009 were enacted during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor tax cuts in time of recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.</p></div>

<p id="ch24mod04_p16">The use of government spending and tax cuts can be a useful tool to affect aggregate demand and it will be discussed in greater detail in the <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@3" class="target-chapter">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a> chapter and <a href="/contents/e97892bf-8113-45f9-892e-107d9adec52f@4" class="target-chapter">The Impacts of Government Borrowing</a>. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as discussed in the <a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2" class="target-chapter">Monetary policy and Bank Regulation</a> chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and the availability of credit. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on big-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates will stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in turn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.</p><p id="ch24mod04_p17">Spelling out the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand can wait for <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@3" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a> chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the relatively flat or relatively steep portion of the AS curve.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod04_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch24mod04_p18">The AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand&#8212;C, I, G, and X&#8211;M&#8212;rise. It will shift back to the left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those resulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will rise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall. Whether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes relatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.</p>
<p id="ch24mod04_p19">The AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface, but in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes of the curves are very different. Long-term economic growth is illustrated in the AD/AS framework by a gradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. A recession is illustrated when the intersection of AD and AS is substantially below potential GDP, while an expanding economy is illustrated when the intersection of AS and AD is near potential GDP.</p></section>

<p id="ch24mod05_p01">The AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the four macroeconomic goals of growth, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation</span>, and a sustainable balance of trade. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes&#8217; law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also including the Say&#8217;s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod05_01"><h1 data-type="title">Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram</h1><p id="ch24mod05_p02">In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the &#8220;full employment level of GDP&#8221;) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. A pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year, was shown earlier in <a href="/contents/8d385e60-e4a6-4f68-932c-072f05e89084@2#CNX_Econ_C24_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate&#8212;like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth&#8212;do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.</p><p id="ch24mod05_p03">In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession. Recessions are illustrated in the AD/AS diagram when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as occurred at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub> in <a href="/contents/bda2d442-3d26-4bfa-a6bb-cc5cd9c1f338@4#CNX_Econ_C24_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. On the other hand, in years of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as shown at equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub> in that earlier figure.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod05_02"><h1 data-type="title">Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram</h1>
<p id="ch24mod05_p04">Two types of unemployment were described in the <a href="/contents/411630a6-6de7-44a1-a937-9c6f0f2341e8@2" class="target-chapter">Unemployment</a> chapter. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Cyclical unemployment</span> bounces up and down according to the short-run movements of GDP. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across Europe, the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic years. This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out is called the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">natural rate of unemployment</span> and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod05_link01" class="note economics linkup" data-label="">

</div><p id="ch24mod05_p06">In the AD/AS diagram, cyclical unemployment is shown by how close the economy is to the potential or full employment level of GDP. Returning to <a href="/contents/bda2d442-3d26-4bfa-a6bb-cc5cd9c1f338@4#CNX_Econ_C24_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub>. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub>. The factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment are not shown separately in the AD/AS model, although they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod05_03"><h1 data-type="title">Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram</h1>
<p id="ch24mod05_p07">Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative&#8212;a situation called &#8220;deflation&#8221;&#8212;during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short recession of 1991&#8211;1992, the rate of inflation declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short recession of 2001, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007&#8211;2009, the rate of inflation declined from 3.8% in 2008 to &#8211;0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid&#8211;1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to be substantially higher or lower; instead, it has stayed in the range of 1&#8211;5% annually.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod05_link02" class="note economics linkup" data-label="">

</div><p id="ch24mod05_p09">The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the steep portion of the AS curve. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right; the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C24_015"><div data-type="title" class="title">Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model</div><figcaption>(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) is at a higher price level (P<sub>1</sub>), while the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) is at the lower price level (P<sub>0</sub>).</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C24_015" data-alt="The two graphs show how a shift in aggregate demand or supply can cause inflationary pressure.

</span>

</figure><p id="ch24mod05_p10">An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy&#8212;perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor&#8212;and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), the shift of the SRAS curve to the left also increases the price level from P<sub>0</sub> at the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to a higher price level of P<sub>1</sub> at the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, being passed along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.</p><p id="ch24mod05_p11">The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the steep portion of the SRAS curve. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, a certain level of inflation may come to be expected. For example, if consumers, workers, and businesses all expect prices and wages to rise by a certain amount, then these expected rises in the price level can become built into the annual increases of prices, wages, and interest rates of the economy. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod05_04"><h1 data-type="title">Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</h1><p id="ch24mod05_p12">Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.</p>
<p id="ch24mod05_p13">The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the budget constraint diagram introduced in the <a href="/contents/7b6fbc95-85e5-4488-9023-6260c8090e19@2" class="target-chapter">Choice in a World of Scarcity</a> chapter and the supply and demand diagram introduced in the <a href="/contents/109e65a0-11d0-47a2-84f4-e57c9ea88fa5@2" class="target-chapter">Demand and Supply</a> chapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing these factors together in one diagram. Indeed, some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the rest of this book.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod05_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch24mod05_p14">Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what is meant by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. Pressures for inflation to rise or fall are shown in the AD/AS framework when the movement from one equilibrium to another causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS model is the key model used in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.</p>

Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the far right of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on the price level.

<p id="ch24mod06_p02">Focus first on the <span data-type="term">Keynesian zone</span>, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about the economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to the right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment). However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not vary much in this zone.</p>















<p id="ch24mod06_p03">Now, focus your attention on the <span data-type="term">neoclassical zone</span> of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy, although structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.</p>















<p id="ch24mod06_p04">Finally, consider the <span data-type="term">intermediate zone</span> of the SRAS curve in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C24_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.</p>















<p id="ch24mod06_p05">This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that can be applied to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out what zone the economy is in and then the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices will be clarified. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@3" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a> and <a href="/contents/3ade4530-6d5c-4eb7-9cae-97952c07ca78@2" class="target-chapter">The Neoclassical Perspective</a> should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the macroeconomy.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch24mod06_bring" class="note economics bringhome" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust</div>
<p id="ch24mod06_p06">Economic fluctuations, whether those experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the stagflation of the 1970s, or the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009, can be explained using the AD/AS diagram. Short-run fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD curve, or both. In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values continued to go up, the increased value would pay off any debt outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and economic growth in the United States. When the housing bubble burst, overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This drop in the value of homes was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its contagion into the financial that essentially locked up new credit. The AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the rising unemployment of the Great Recession.</p>

<p id="ch24mod06_p07">Understanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided monetary and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions to take to mitigate the impact of the housing crisis. From a monetary policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts, and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.</p>

<p id="ch24mod06_p08">While most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations. We discuss the possible policy actions and the differences among economists about their effectiveness in more detail in <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@3" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a>, <a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2" class="target-chapter">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>, and <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@3" class="target-chapter">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>.</p></div>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch24mod06_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch24mod06_p09">The SRAS curve can be divided into three zones. Keynes&#8217; law says demand creates its own supply, so that changes in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. Keynes&#8217; law can be shown on the horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS curve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level. Say&#8217;s law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and employment, only on the price level. Say&#8217;s law can be shown on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so movements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall in AD will lead to a lower output and price level.</p>

<p id="ch25mod00_p01">The Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 hit the U.S. economy hard. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009 when 326,392 workers were given notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.</p><p id="ch25mod00_p02">Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, programs such as the American Restoration and Recovery Act were implemented to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying &#8220;cash for clunkers,&#8221; and extending unemployment benefits.  From cutting back on spending, filing for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. And while the United States is now on the path to recovery, the impact will be felt for many years to come.
</p><p id="ch25mod00_p03">What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the Great Depression of the 1930s and to the models developed by John Maynard Keynes to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country&#8217;s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.</p></div>

<p id="ch25mod01_p01">The Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation&#8217;s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span>, the amount of goods and services actually being sold, known as <span data-type="term">real GDP</span>, depends on how much demand exists across the economy. This point is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_031" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_031"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Keynesian AD/AS Model</div><figcaption>The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices; any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C25_031" data-alt="Keynesian view of the AD/AS model shows that with a horizontal AS, a decrease in demand leads to a decrease in output, but no decrease in prices.">

</span>

</figure><p id="ch25mod01_p02">Keynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable&#8212;that it can change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P<sub>0</sub> and Yp. Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a <span data-type="term">recessionary gap</span>. The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment, as shown at Y<sub>1</sub> in the <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_031" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p03">In the same way (though not shown in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an <span data-type="term">inflationary gap</span>, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. As a consequence, the economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p04">Recall from <a href="/contents/dce57e88-69b4-4de1-8122-f45ecdd3bda3@4" class="target-chapter">The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model</a> that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span> is total spending, economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure. Read the appendix on <a href="/contents/82baa7dd-7876-4724-a4f7-2bb756395725@2">The Expenditure-Output Model</a> for more on this.) You may also remember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following sections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_01"><h1 data-type="title">What Determines Consumption Expenditure?</h1>
<p id="ch25mod02_p05">Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are things that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries&#8212;once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">services</span> are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p06">Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:</p>
<ul id="ch25mod02_list01" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Disposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as <span data-type="term">disposable income</span>, which is income after taxes.</li>
<li>Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on consumption.</li>
<li>Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for example, U.S. rates of saving declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased and there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so rates of saving increased while consumption declined.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ch25mod02_p07">Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the right.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_02"><h1 data-type="title">What Determines Investment Expenditure?</h1>
<p id="ch25mod02_p09">Spending on new capital goods is called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">investment expenditure</span>. Investment falls into four categories: producer&#8217;s durable equipment and software, new nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings). The first three types of investment are conducted by businesses, while the last is conducted by households.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p10">Keynes&#8217;s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both the expected benefits of the investment (expectations of future profits) and the costs of the investment (interest rates).</p>
<ul id="ch25mod02_list02" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of the benefits of an investment is expectations for future profits. When an economy is expected to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.</li>
<li>Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interest rate</span>. Even if the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ch25mod02_p11">Many factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the price of energy declines, then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_03"><h1 data-type="title">What Determines Government Spending?</h1>
<p id="ch25mod02_p12">The third component of aggregate demand is spending by federal, state, and local governments. Although the United States is usually thought of as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in <a href="/contents/e3af44f9-4260-4a82-b34c-41082b88656a@2" class="target-chapter">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities</a> and <a href="/contents/19192c04-7ce0-4933-8c1b-4beff0471f76@2" class="target-chapter">Positive Externalities and Public Goods</a>, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p13">Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could AD be stimulated by more government spending (or reduced by less government spending), but consumption and investment spending could be influenced by lowering or raising tax rates. Indeed, Keynes concluded that during extreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate demand.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_04"><h1 data-type="title">What Determines Net Exports?</h1><p id="ch25mod02_p14">Recall that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exports</span> are products produced domestically and sold abroad while <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">imports</span> are products produced abroad but purchased domestically. Since aggregate demand is defined as spending on domestic goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.</p>
<p id="ch25mod02_p15">Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between countries and changes in relative prices between countries. The level of demand for a nation&#8217;s exports tends to be most heavily affected by what is happening in the economies of the countries that would be purchasing those exports. For example, if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the quantity of a nation&#8217;s imports is directly affected by the amount of income in the domestic economy: more income will bring a higher level of imports.</p>
<p id="ch25mod02_p16">Exports and imports can also be affected by relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets. If U.S. goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.</p>
<p id="ch25mod02_p17"><a href="#ch25mod02_tbl01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> summarizes the reasons given here for changes in aggregate demand.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch25mod02_p18">Aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes, expectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels. Investment will change in response to its expected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of new technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also change when interest rates rise or fall. Government spending and taxes are determined by political considerations. Exports and imports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.</p>

<p id="ch25mod03_p01">Now that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using Keynes&#8217; income-expenditure model, see the appendix on <a href="/contents/82baa7dd-7876-4724-a4f7-2bb756395725@2">The Expenditure-Output Model</a>.)</p><p id="ch25mod03_p02">Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span> is based on two key building blocks. First, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of <span data-type="term">sticky wages and prices</span>, which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are represented in the AD/AS model.</p><p id="ch25mod03_p03">The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as occurred in 1929. Or, suppose the housing market collapses, as occurred in 2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease investment expenditure.</p>







<p id="ch25mod03_p04">This seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929&#8212;and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what happened in 2008.</p><p id="ch25mod03_p05">As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say&#8217;s law that &#8220;supply creates its own demand.&#8221; Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP.</p>

</div><section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod03_01"><h1 data-type="title">Wage and Price Stickiness</h1><p id="ch25mod03_p07">Keynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are &#8220;sticky,&#8221; making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the <span data-type="term">coordination argument</span>. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing&#8212;at least hypothetically&#8212;to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions. <a href="/contents/411630a6-6de7-44a1-a937-9c6f0f2341e8@2" class="target-chapter">Unemployment</a> proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p08">Some modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky, too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must analyze the competition and market demand and decide what the new prices will be, sales materials must be updated, billing records will change, and product labels and price labels must be redone. Second, frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry&#8212;especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected. These costs of changing prices are called <span data-type="term">menu costs</span>&#8212;like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.</p>
<p id="ch25mod02_p09">To understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrating the overall labor market, while <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>) and supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>). When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D<sub>1</sub>) in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and the demand for goods shifts to the left (to D<sub>1</sub>) in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the wage remains at its original level (W<sub>0</sub>) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P<sub>0</sub>).</p><p id="ch25mod02_p10">As a result, a situation of excess supply&#8212;where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or price&#8212;exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q<sub>1</sub> is less than Q<sub>0</sub> in both <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_024"><div data-type="title" class="title">Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods Market</div><figcaption>In both (a) and (b), demand shifts left from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original wage (W<sub>0</sub>) is Q<sub>0</sub>, but with the new demand curve for labor (D<sub>1</sub>), it will be Q<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P<sub>0</sub>) is Q<sub>0</sub>, but at the new demand curve (D<sub>1</sub>) it will be Q<sub>1</sub>. An excess supply of labor will exist, which is called unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.</figcaption>

<p id="ch25mod02_p11">The recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a larger trend in job growth and pay in the post&#8211;recession recovery.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_028"><div data-type="title" class="title">Jobs Lost/Gained in the Recession/Recovery</div><figcaption>Data in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggests that jobs lost were in mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage occupations.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="CNX_Econ_C25_028m" data-alt="The chart on the left shows that the majority of jobs lost during the recession were from people working mid-wage occupations (60%).

</span>

</figure><p id="ch25mod02_p12">The National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. This data is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_028" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><p id="ch25mod02_p13">Wages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly &#8220;sticky.&#8221; Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws; they may be upwardly sticky if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012, pushing real wages down.</p>

<p id="ch25mod02_p14">These two Keynesian assumptions&#8212;the importance of aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices&#8212;are illustrated by the AD/AS diagram in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_035" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Note that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_035" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This outcome is an important example of a <span data-type="term">macroeconomic externality</span>, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level.  For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales. But if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which would be shown as a movement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level).</p><p id="ch25mod02_p15">The original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD<sub>0</sub>) intersects with AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y<sub>1</sub>, the economy experiences substantial unemployment.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_035"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Keynesian Perspective of Recession</div><figcaption>The equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) illustrates the two key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. The importance of aggregate demand is shown because this equilibrium is a recession which has occurred because aggregate demand is at AD<sub>1</sub> instead of AD<sub>0</sub>. The importance of sticky wages and prices is shown because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which make the SRAS curve flat below potential GDP. Thus, when AD falls, the intersection E<sub>1</sub> occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where the price level does not change.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C25_035" data-alt="The graph shows three aggregate demand curves and one aggregate supply curve.

<p id="ch25mod02_p016">A key concept in Keynesian economics is the <span data-type="term">expenditure multiplier</span>. The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.</p><div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="ch25mod02_eq1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow>

</div><p id="ch25mod02_p17">The reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person&#8217;s spending becomes another person&#8217;s income, which leads to additional spending and additional income, and so forth, so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. While the multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration&#8217;s fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</span>.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch25mod02_p18">Keynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply to be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result. The latter is an example of a macroeconomic externality. While surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level; instead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices. These include internal costs a business faces in changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers. Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure multiplier&#8212;the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.</p>

   <div data-type="document-title">The Expenditure-Output (or Keynesian Cross) Model</div>







  <p id="fs-id1165288234366">The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained with a different model, known as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy, with no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287089325"><h1 data-type="title">The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287031246">The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram, determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced. The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Expenditure-Output Diagram</div><figcaption>The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium. Equilibrium occurs at E<sub>0</sub>, where aggregate expenditure AE<sub>0</sub> is equal to the output level Y<sub>0</sub>.</figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165287166236">Remember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income (Y). At some points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as &#8220;national income.&#8221; Both axes are measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165286945253"><h1 data-type="title">The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287032692">The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286944002">The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287132629">When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP&#8212;because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal&#8212;which will only occur along the 45-degree line.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287067352"><h1 data-type="title">The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287147248">The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line&#8212;at point E<sub>0</sub> in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>&#8212;will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how to interpret it.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165286754113"><h1 data-type="title">Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165286800062">Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287068679">Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line&#8212;consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports&#8212;the key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287044236"><h1 data-type="title">Consumption as a Function of National Income</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165286859396">How do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let&#8217;s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true that:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-id1165284514724"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>MPC&#160;+&#160;MPS&#160;=&#160;1</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>MPC&#160;+&#160;MPS&#160;=&#160;1</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-id1165287121767">For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165284487019">With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. (Note that we use &#8220;Aggregate Expenditure&#8221; on the vertical axis in this and the following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287122100">An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200. At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#Table_E_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is called the consumption function.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_012"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Consumption Function </div><figcaption>In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-id1165287100525">The pattern of consumption shown in <a href="#Table_E_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is plotted in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. To calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165286746177">However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in <a href="#Table_E_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. When the consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287186927"><h1 data-type="title">Investment as a Function of National Income</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287021067">Investment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do <em data-effect="italics">not</em> depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an investment function where the level of investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Investment Function</div><figcaption>The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.</figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165286928522">The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment&#8212;new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment&#8212;can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287117106"><h1 data-type="title">Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287164230">In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Government Spending Function </div><figcaption>The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-id1165286787126" data-alt="">

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165286779738">The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together, government typically collects about 30&#8211;35 % of income as taxes.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286755848"><a href="#Table_E_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_015"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes</div><figcaption>The upper line repeats the consumption function from <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

<p id="fs-id1165287067988">The export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country&#8217;s own real GDP, is drawn as a horizontal line, as in the example in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis&#8212;that is, a country&#8217;s own level of domestic production&#8212;and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_025"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Export and Import Functions</div><figcaption>(a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by &#8211;0.1.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-id1165287177982">Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income.

Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports are $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to import, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165286871152">Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The multiplier equation in this case is:</p>

<p id="fs-id1165286859557">Thus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the same as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286770440">This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287095444">All the components of aggregate demand&#8212;consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade balance&#8212;are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_018" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> builds up an aggregate expenditure function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The first three columns in <a href="#Table_E_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are lifted from the earlier <a href="#Table_E_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, which showed how to bring taxes into the consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 &#215; 0.8) from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, aggregate expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X &#8211; M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_018" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-id1165286792472">The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import function. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures&#8212;which do not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter&#8212;because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic goods and services.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286906701">The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287176911">With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165286744165">The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X &#8211; M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_018" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, this point of equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off <a href="#Table_E_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286907223">The meaning of &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_019" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold&#8212;not a sustainable state of affairs.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_019"><div data-type="title" class="title">Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram</div><figcaption>If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.</figcaption>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165286967336">Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L&#8212;where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287093784">In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287167247">For example, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at point E<sub>0</sub>, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287102724">The distance between an output level like E<sub>0</sub> that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_026"><div data-type="title" class="title">Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps</div><figcaption>(a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule up from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> occurs at potential GDP.</figcaption>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165284640500">What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time; remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession away.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287085182">The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> now occurs at potential GDP as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a).</p>
<p id="fs-id1165284469849">Conversely, <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE<sub>0</sub>) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a na&#239;ve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired&#8212;even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and market institutions.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287104876">The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286995226">The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line AE<sub>0</sub> and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE<sub>0</sub> shifts down to AE<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium is at E<sub>1</sub>, then the economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government expenditures.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165287194344"><h1 data-type="title">The Multiplier Effect</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287097328">The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 &#8211; $700 = $100; so raise government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers, and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is called the multiplier effect: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165284845619"><h1 data-type="title">How Does the Multiplier Work?</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165284469651">To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment, potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced goods and services.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287085453">As shown in the calculations in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#Table_E_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, so that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 &#215; $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 &#215; $28.09).</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_022"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Multiplier Effect</div><figcaption>An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-id1165284636596">Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed&#8212;nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287187113">A change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of $213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> after many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287187102">The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These three factors are known as &#8220;leakages,&#8221; because they determine how much demand &#8220;leaks out&#8221; in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second, third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages&#8212;a change in the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import&#8212;will change the size of the multiplier.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165284825442"><h1 data-type="title">Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions</h1>
<p id="fs-id1165287187216">Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_023"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model </div><figcaption>The power of the multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical increase from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.</figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-id1165287031926">The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the aggregate expenditure function (AE<sub>0</sub>) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE<sub>1</sub>, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to reach potential GDP.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287144866">Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_026" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income&#8211;expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic calculation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165284469413">The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-id1165284469415" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?</div>
<p id="fs-id1165287071154">Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent article, &#8220;Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,&#8221; James Joyner of <em data-effect="italics">Outside the Beltway</em> looked at public financing for NFL teams. Joyner&#8217;s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286766576">Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let&#8217;s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let&#8217;s assume that they save one-third of their after-tax income.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286766579">However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let&#8217;s say that one-half of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287097474">Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional athletes, so let&#8217;s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher proportion of their income on local goods&#8212;say, 65%.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286772841">If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is recycled into the local economy.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286772844">Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet search for &#8220;economic impact of sports&#8221; will yield numerous reports questioning this economic development strategy.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287174183">Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286770985">However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.</p>

<p id="fs-id1165287177039">The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287009945">The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165287009948">In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165286753192">The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings, taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-id1165288362639">

<p id="fs-id1165287093694">The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80% then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received by another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the multiplier, take the 1/1 &#8211; F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.</p>

<p id="ch25mod03_p01">The simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes&#8217;s original model. More recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than the right angle used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far below potential (&#8220;the Keynesian zone&#8221;), very steep at levels of output above potential (&#8220;the neoclassical zone&#8221;) and curved in between (&#8220;the intermediate zone&#8221;). This is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_034" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The typical aggregate supply curve leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_034"><div data-type="title" class="title">Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve</div><figcaption>Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level.

Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone, at the far right of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP (as represented by the LRAS line) largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C25_034" data-alt="The graph shows three aggregate demand curves to represent different zones: the Keynesian zone, the intermediate zone, and the neoclassical zone.

<p id="ch25mod03_p02">In the 1950s, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">A.W. Phillips</span>, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, which became known as a <span data-type="term">Phillips curve</span>. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_02"><h1 data-type="title">The Instability of the Phillips Curve</h1>
<p id="ch25mod03_p14">During the 1960s, the Phillips curve was seen as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation and high unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Fiscal and monetary policy could be used to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a curious thing happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result was an increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened? The Phillips curve shifted.</p><p id="ch25mod03_p15">The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation. This pattern became known as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">stagflation</span>. (Recall from <a href="/contents/dce57e88-69b4-4de1-8122-f45ecdd3bda3@4" class="target-chapter">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</a> that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that could not be explained by traditional Keynesian economics.</p><p id="ch25mod03_p16">Economists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply shocks, like the Oil Crisis of the mid-1970s, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in people&#8217;s expectations about inflation. In other words, there may be a tradeoff between <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment</span> when people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both factors (supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus the Phillips curve, to shift.</p>
<p id="ch25mod03_p17">In short, a downward-sloping Phillips curve should be interpreted as valid for short-run periods of several years, but over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that unemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early 1990s or first decade of the 2000s).</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod02_03"><h1 data-type="title">Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation</h1>
<p id="ch25mod03_p18">Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is <span data-type="term">expansionary fiscal policy</span>, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.</p>
<p id="ch25mod03_p19">Keynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads, and other amenities, he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical ways, then it could spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a modern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money underground, and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again. These suggestions were slightly tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span>.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C25_010"><div data-type="title" class="title">Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian Policy</div><figcaption>If an economy is in recession, with an equilibrium at Er, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr toward ADf. If an economy is experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy response to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C25_010" data-alt="The graph shows three possible downward-sloping AD curves, an upward-sloping AS curve, and a vertical, straight potential GDP line.">

</span>

</figure>

<p id="ch25mod03_p20">The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response would be <span data-type="term">contractionary fiscal policy</span>, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left. The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C25_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, so that the economy was experiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while the economy remains at full employment.</p>

<p id="ch25mod03_p21">In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment and too much brings inflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; level of aggregate demand: not too much, not too little, but looking for what is just right.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod03_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch25mod03_p22">A Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian viewpoint, the Phillips curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower inflation, and vice versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.</p>
<p id="ch25mod03_p23">Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.</p>

<p id="ch25mod03_p25">A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause the AS curve to shift out to the right, yielding more real GDP at a lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward the origin, meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation.</p>

<p id="ch25mod04_p01">Ever since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy has simmered over the extent to which government should play an active role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation and misery of the Great Depression, many people&#8212;including many economists&#8212;became more aware of vulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.</p>















<p id="ch25mod03_p02">However, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well individual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing and able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers&#8212;the problem is that insufficient aggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task did not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take over and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.</p>







<p id="ch25mod03_p03">Even if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world, can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and uncertainties as policies are enacted into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate demand? <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@3" class="target-chapter">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a> will probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its focus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates in the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. In <a href="/contents/3ade4530-6d5c-4eb7-9cae-97952c07ca78@2" class="target-chapter">The Neoclassical Perspective</a>, we will consider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-run macroeconomic analysis.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch25mod03_bring" class="note economics bringhome" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">The Great Recession</div>
<p id="ch25mod03_04">The lessons learned during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the aggregate expenditure model proposed by John Maynard Keynes gave the modern economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate the treacherous economy in the latter half of the 2000s. In &#8220;How the Great Recession Was Brought to an End,&#8221; Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi wrote that the actions taken by today&#8217;s policymakers stand in sharp contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression. Today&#8217;s economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax rebates to &#8220;Cash for Clunkers&#8221; to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment. Although these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch25mod03_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch25mod03_p04">The Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the macroeconomic level&#8212;increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate demand when private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be passing laws or regulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.</p>

        <p id="ch26mod00_p02">The Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the overall health of the economy. These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the years since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial system's credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of dollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were struggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end, policymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and domestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:</p><ul id="ch26mod00_list02">
<li>Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing this, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to the business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent and had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.</li>

<li>The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash into troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer spending.</li>
</ul>
        <p id="ch26mod00_p03">Four years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy has yet to return to its pre-recession levels of productivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7% annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remains above the natural rate, and real GDP continues to lag behind potential growth. The actions taken to stabilize the economy are still under scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective on economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective. At the end of the chapter, we will use the neoclassical perspective to analyze the actions taken in the Great Recession.</p>

    <p id="ch26mod00_p04">In Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105&#176; in July 1995, while the lowest recorded temperature was 27&#176; below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns occurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.</p><p id="ch26mod00_p05">A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Depression</span> of the 1930s or what many have called the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Recession</span> of 2008&#8211;2009. If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in 2009. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept returning to the general neighborhood of 5.0&#8211;5.5%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out its long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed, the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. From a long-run perspective, the economy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.</p><p id="ch26mod00_p06">As the name &#8220;neoclassical&#8221; implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a &#8220;new&#8221; view of the &#8220;old&#8221; classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices, adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full employment GDP, and prescribed a &#8220;hands off&#8221; policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into recession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods. This surplus would be eliminated with falling prices, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP; no active fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p01">The <span data-type="term">neoclassical perspective</span> on macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics: (1) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP, and (2) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy implication is this: Should the government focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment? This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Keynesian economics</span> is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run. Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how they can be embodied in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand/aggregate supply model</span>.</p><section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod01_01"><h1 data-type="title">The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run</h1>
    <p id="ch26mod01_p02">Over the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to &#8220;potential GDP&#8221; they are referring to that level of output that can be achieved when all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, the economy is said to be at the natural rate of unemployment or at full employment.</p>

    <p id="ch26mod01_p03">Actual or <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span> is benchmarked against the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span> to determine how well the economy is performing. Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology. <span data-type="term">Physical capital per person</span> refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.</p>

    <p id="ch26mod01_p04">To see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2012. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">human capital</span> of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college degree.  The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care&#8212;the list of technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.</p><p id="ch26mod01_p05">This growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from 2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at potential GDP&#8212;or even slightly ahead. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the actual data for the increase in nominal GDP since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1&#8211;3% below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.</p>

A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate supply</span> (or potential GDP) will determine the real GDP of the economy, regardless of the level of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span>. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right.

<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod01_02"><h1 data-type="title">The Role of Flexible Prices</h1>
    <p id="ch26mod01_p07">How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate demand increases or decreases? The neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts is based on the insight that even if wages and prices are &#8220;sticky&#8221;, or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over time. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.</p>

    <p id="ch26mod01_p08">The aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows two aggregate supply curves. The original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD<sub>0</sub>, is drawn so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E<sub>0</sub>, at which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C26_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD Increases</div><figcaption>The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS<sub>0</sub>). The output at E<sub>0</sub> is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium is E<sub>1</sub>, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates unsustainably low, wages are bid up by eager employers, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C26_003" data-alt="The graph shows two aggregate demand curves and two aggregate supply curves that all intersect with the Potential GDP line at 50 on the x-axis.

</span>

</figure><p id="ch26mod01_p09">Now, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, leading to a new equilibrium at point E<sub>1</sub> with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p10">In the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment and there is a shortage of labor. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to put in longer hours. This high demand for labor will drive up wages. Most workers have their salaries reviewed only once or twice a year, and so it will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, because the price of a major input to production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.</p><p id="ch26mod01_p11">This description of the short-run shift from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> and the long-run shift from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub> is a step-by-step way of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p12">The rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS<sub>0</sub> showing the original upward sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate demand&#8212;for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads to less consumption and more saving&#8212;causes the original aggregate demand curve AD<sub>0</sub> to shift back to AD<sub>1</sub>. The shift from the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) results in a decline in output. The economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen from time to time during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower price level in the AD&#8211;AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the rate of inflation. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines the real GDP of this economy.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C26_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand</div><figcaption>The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS<sub>0</sub>). The output at E<sub>0</sub> is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium is at E<sub>1</sub>, with a lower output level of 450 and downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of 110.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="mCNX_Econ_C26_004" data-alt="The graph shows two aggregate demand curves and two aggregate supply curves that all intersect with the Potential GDP line at 50 on the x-axis.

</span>

</figure><p id="ch26mod01_p13">Again, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down on pay increases&#8212;or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>). The overall impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>, is that the level of output returns to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on unemployment&#8212;but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply determine the size of real GDP.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod01_03"><h1 data-type="title">How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?</h1>
<p id="ch26mod01_p14">How long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound back to its potential GDP? This subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to those immortal words of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">John Maynard Keynes</span>, &#8220;In the long run we are all dead,&#8221; neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p15">One subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed. The theory of <span data-type="term">rational expectations</span> holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p16">To understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up the value of homes in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that it is going to hire many more people or the city announces that it is going to build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust immediately.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p17">At a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading&#8212;toward a change in the price level&#8212;and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way and then the other.</p>

<p id="ch26mod01_p18">The theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with <span data-type="term">adaptive expectations</span>: they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.</p><p id="ch26mod01_p19">The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. Indeed, the speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod01_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch26mod01_p20">Neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as vertical. A rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic events and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information and how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.</p>

<p id="ch26mod02_p01">To understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian perspective. Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?</p><p id="ch26mod02_p02">Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span>, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring&#8212;and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a tax cut or a spending increase; the amount of those tax or spending changes may be determined as much by political considerations as economic ones; and then the economy will take still more months to put changes in aggregate demand into effect through spending and production. When all of these time lags and political realities are considered, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy kicks in, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government fine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them. Indeed, some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch26mod02_clear01" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Why and how are inflation expectations measured?</div>
<p id="ch26mod02_p03">People take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an <span data-type="term">expected inflation</span> factor. Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, on the other hand, inflation is expected to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and the lowering of interest rates, in the short run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about financing investments.</p>
<p id="ch26mod02_p04">Expectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact, inflation expectations are measured by the Federal Reserve Bank based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist for the <em data-effect="italics">Philadelphia Inquirer</em>. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the survey was continued by the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p>
<p id="ch26mod02_p05">Current research by the Federal Reserve compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the results, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few decades. Economists are actively researching how expectations of inflation and other economic variables are formed and changed.</p>

The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same. Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve relationship, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation.

</span>
</figure></p>
<p id="step2">Step 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.</p>
<p id="step3">Step 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the graph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%; this is the rate that the economy appears to adjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an increase in aggregate demand; the unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985, the economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.</p>
<p id="step4">Step 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural rate of unemployment.</p></div><p id="ch26mod02_p09">The unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small inflationary increase in the price level from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economist <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Milton Friedman</span> (1912&#8211;2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech: &#8220;[T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off.&#8221;</p>
<p id="ch26mod02_p10">In the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, AD should be adjusted so that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, unemployment is determined by the natural rate of unemployment churned out by the forces of supply and demand in the labor market, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary determinant of changes in the price level.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch26mod02_link02" class="note economics linkup" data-label="">

Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP&#8212;giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of the dynamics of the labor market, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a &#8220;bad&#8221; thing. After all, there will always be workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and this is what is measured by the natural rate of unemployment.</p><p id="ch26mod02_p13">The neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the problem of cyclical unemployment&#8212;that is, unemployment caused by recession&#8212;while putting more attention on the issue of the rates of unemployment that prevail even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how public policy can be adjusted to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed), policy can be designed to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek employment.</p>

<p id="ch26mod02_p14">Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after all, if economic output is determined by a vertical <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate supply curve</span>, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right&#8212;keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low.</p>

<p id="ch26mod02_p15">If <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span> rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>, the price level rises, but real GDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely, reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about <a href="#CNX_Econ_C26_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> in reverse, as the aggregate demand curve shifts from AD<sub>2</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>0</sub>, and the equilibrium moves from E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>0</sub>. During this process, the price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural rate of unemployment is changed.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C26_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long Run</div><figcaption>As aggregate demand shifts to the right, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change.

<p id="ch26mod02_p17">Neoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953&#8211;1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973&#8211;1992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993&#8211;2014, productivity growth increased slightly to 2% per year. The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy&#8217;s investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented environment that rewards innovation. Promotion of these factors is what government policy should focus on.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod02_04"><h1 data-type="title">Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations</h1>
<p id="ch26mod02_p18">Let&#8217;s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in &#8220;fine-tuning&#8221; the economy. They believe that economic growth is fostered by a stable economic environment with a low rate of inflation. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote improvements in technology.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod02_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch26mod02_p20">Neoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on long-term growth than on fighting recession, because they believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term growth will ultimately determine the standard of living. They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by economic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.</p>
<p id="ch26mod02_p21">Neoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve, inflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical AS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate demand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes in the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the quantity of output is consistent with many different price levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.</p>

<p id="ch26mod02_p23">An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the rate that is consistent with potential GDP and with the natural rate of unemployment.

However, over time the extremely low unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift the short-run AS curve back to the left. The result would be a higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP and the natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS curve. If the government continues this policy, it will continually be pushing the price level higher and higher, but it will not be able to achieve its goal of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with market forces.</p></div>

<p id="ch26mod02_p26">The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of as a version of neoclassical economics because it argues that potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market forces as wages and prices adjust. However, it is an &#8220;extreme&#8221; version because it argues that this adjustment takes place very quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that adjustment to the neoclassical outcome takes a few years.</p>

<p id="ch26mod03_p01">Finding the balance between Keynesian and Neoclassical models can be compared to the challenge of riding two horses simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride into the future on two horses&#8212;with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical perspective&#8212;the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.</p><p id="ch26mod03_p02">The short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run adjustments of aggregate demand, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Keynesian economics</span> risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.</p>















<p id="ch26mod03_p03">The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Depression</span> of the 1930s. Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment.</p>























<p id="ch26mod03_p04">Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Robert Solow</span>, the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way: </p>















<p id="ch26mod03_q01"></p><blockquote id="fs-idm26910752">At short time scales, I think, something sort of &#8216;Keynesian&#8217; is a good approximation, and surely better than anything straight &#8216;neoclassical.&#8217; At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and look for a hybrid model that will do the job.</blockquote><p id="ch26mod03_p05">Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.</p>















<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="ch26mod03_bring" class="note economics bringhome" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Navigating Unchartered Waters</div>
<p id="ch26mod03_p06">Were the policies implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective? Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody&#8217;s Analytics found that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler. Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, <em data-effect="italics">Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect?</em> that once policies were implemented, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.</p><p id="eip-454">The difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the stabilization policies that were taken in response to the Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened had those policies not have been implemented. Surely some of the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while other programs were less so. The final conclusion on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the value of the U.S. dollar in the financial market.</p></div>















<section data-depth="1" id="ch26mod03_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="ch26mod03_p07">The Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full employment.</p>
<p id="ch26mod03_p08">The neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. The level of potential GDP is determined by long term productivity growth and that the economy typically will return to full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of Keynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for active stabilization policy.</p>
<p id="ch26mod03_p09">While Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when counteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists; any short-term gains in lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation.</p>

<p id="ch26mod03_p11">The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by focusing on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm1429952" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bitcoins</div><p id="fs-idm47779376">Here is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item was used for money over the broadest geographic area and for the longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious metal. It is the cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early as 700 B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India and Africa. For several centuries after that, cowries were used in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India, and China for a wide range of purchases: everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a way of paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p id="fs-idp83822608">What made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely durable&#8212;lasting a century or more. As the late economic historian Karl Polyani put it, they can be &#8220;poured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps&#8221; while remaining &#8220;clean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.&#8221; Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a certain size, or&#8212;for large purchases&#8212;by measuring the weight or volume of the total shells to be exchanged. Third, it was impossible to counterfeit a cowrie shell, but gold or silver coins could be counterfeited by making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s, the collection of cowries was tightly controlled, first by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch and the English. As a result, the supply of cowries was allowed to grow quickly enough to serve the needs of commerce, but not so quickly that they were no longer scarce.
Money throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to evolve even today. What do you think money is?</p>

<p id="fs-idm78687328">Money for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account. Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842&#8211;1914) wrote in 1911, money is a &#8220;blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we part with it.&#8221; Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus money must be widely accepted by both buyers and sellers. This concept of money is intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm27447296"><h1 data-type="title">Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants</h1>
<p id="fs-idp21122880">To understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system. <span data-type="term">Barter</span>&#8212;literally trading one good or service for another&#8212;is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve a <span data-type="term">double coincidence of wants</span>, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different jobs and goods.</p>
	<p id="fs-idp49478480">Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for the purchase of many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep  these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and services and enjoying leisure time is spent bartering.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp67573392"><h1 data-type="title">Functions for Money</h1>
<p id="fs-idp107091424">Money solves the problems created by the barter system. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money serves as a <span data-type="term">medium of exchange</span>, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money. This money is then used to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, money must be very widely accepted as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.</p>

<p id="fs-idm128840144">Second, money must serve as a <span data-type="term">store of value</span>. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services. But she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse for future use&#8212;their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not require that money is a <em data-effect="italics">perfect</em> store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power each year, but it remains money.</p><p id="fs-idp49879088">Third, money serves as a <span data-type="term">unit of account</span>, which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured. For example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.</p>
<p id="fs-idp59807728">Finally, another function of money is that money must serve as a <span data-type="term">standard of deferred payment</span>. This means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the <em data-effect="italics">future</em>. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. So <span data-type="term">money</span> serves all of these functions&#8212; it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm86097296"><h1 data-type="title">Commodity versus Fiat Money</h1>
<p id="fs-idp66271360">Money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. Gold, silver, cowrie shells, cigarettes, and even cocoa beans have been used as money. Although these items are used as <span data-type="term">commodity money</span>, they also have a value from use as something other than money. Gold, for example, has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes. Gold is a good conductor of electricity and is used in the electronics and aerospace industry. Gold is also used in the manufacturing of energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry.</p><p id="fs-idm88281536">As commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account. <span data-type="term">Commodity-backed currencies</span> are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank. During much of its history, the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have &#8220;Silver Certificate&#8221; printed over the portrait of George Washington, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. This meant that the holder could take the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar&#8217;s worth of silver.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. Bill</div><figcaption>Until 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed money&#8212;backed by silver, as indicated by the words &#8220;Silver Certificate&#8221; printed on the bill. Today, U.S. bills are backed by the Federal Reserve, but as fiat money.

</figure><p id="fs-idm56809936">As economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of <span data-type="term">fiat money</span>. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country. The United States&#8217; paper money, for example, carries the statement: &#8220;THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.&#8221; In other words, by government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency has value, and nothing more.</p>

<p id="fs-idm86729008">Money is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were not available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify others with whom they have a double coincidence of wants&#8212;that is, each party has a specific good or service that the other desires. Money serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country.</p>

Chips do not work very well as money once you leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to spend money from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie theater.</p>

<p id="fs-idm1160560">Cash in your pocket certainly serves as money. But what about checks or credit cards? Are they money, too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Liquidity</span> refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. Your $10 bill can be easily used to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, $10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is
<em data-effect="italics">less</em> liquid.</p><p id="fs-idp21739664">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve Bank</span>, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money supply. <span data-type="term">M1 money supply</span> includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler&#8217;s checks <span data-type="term">M2 money supply</span> is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds.</p><p id="fs-idp19112560">M1 money supply includes <span data-type="term">coins and currency in circulation</span>&#8212;the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury, at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable deposits, also known as <span data-type="term">demand deposits</span>. These are the amounts held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the deposit holder his money &#8220;on demand&#8221; when a check is written or a debit card is used. These items together&#8212;currency, and checking accounts in banks&#8212;make up the definition of money known as M1, which is measured daily by the Federal Reserve System. Traveler&#8217;s checks are a also included in M1, but have decreased in use over the recent past.</p>















<p id="fs-idp11255488">A broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example, M2 includes <span data-type="term">savings deposits</span> in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in <span data-type="term">money market funds</span>, where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">certificates of deposit (CDs)</span> or <span data-type="term">time deposits</span>, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money </div><figcaption>M1 and M2 money have several definitions, ranging from narrow to broad.

<p id="fs-idm7139248">The lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes elements of M1 are not treated alike; for example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept traveler&#8217;s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the Internet, which has made it easier to access savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the strengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.</p>















<p id="fs-idm41313488">Where does &#8220;plastic money&#8221; like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A <span data-type="term">debit card</span>, like a check, is an instruction to the user&#8217;s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is<em data-effect="italics">checkable deposits</em> that are money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a <span data-type="term">credit card</span>, it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When you make a purchase with a credit card, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company. With a <span data-type="term">smart card</span>, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases. Some &#8220;smart cards&#8221; used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places.</p><p id="fs-idm17403200">In short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made. But having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the economy, any more than having more checks printed increases the amount of money in your checking account.</p>















<p id="fs-idm22013216">One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins; instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. Indeed, the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">banking system</span>. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation&#8217;s banking system has the power to create money.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp25454384" class="note economics linkup">

  <p id="fs-idm8208960">The late bank robber named Willie Sutton was once asked why he robbed banks. He answered: &#8220;That&#8217;s where the money is.&#8221; While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.</p>















<p id="fs-idp5308320">Banks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if all payments had to be made in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.</p>















<p id="fs-idp88895728">Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the <span data-type="term">payment system</span>, which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash <span data-type="term">Transaction costs</span> are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries&#8212;they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key role in the creation of money.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp53871648"><h1 data-type="title">Banks as Financial Intermediaries</h1><p id="fs-idm18311520">An &#8220;intermediary&#8221; is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are a <span data-type="term">financial intermediary</span>&#8212;that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds, but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be <span data-type="term">depository institutions</span>, which are institutions that accept money <em data-effect="italics">deposits</em> and then use these to make loans. All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool, which is then loaned out. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">Banks as Financial Intermediaries</div><figcaption>Banks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest.

<p id="fs-idp25341328">Banks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as explained, receive deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money.
Savings institutions are also sometimes called &#8220;savings and loans&#8221; or &#8220;thrifts.&#8221; They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate developers and builders.</p>
<p id="fs-idp48396976">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">credit union</span> is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on making loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.</p><p id="fs-idp66927360">In 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007&#8211;2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were 6,535 credit unions with assets totaling $1.1 billion.  A day of &#8220;Transfer Your Money&#8221; took place in 2009 out of general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as large as $50 million. However, as of 2013,  the 12 largest banks (0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp37902256"><h1 data-type="title">A Bank&#8217;s Balance Sheet</h1><p id="fs-idp149122864">A <span data-type="term">balance sheet</span> is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. An <span data-type="term">asset</span> is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something. For example, the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition. If you own a home, this is also considered an asset. A <span data-type="term">liability</span> is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The <span data-type="term">net worth</span> is the asset value minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank&#8217;s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank&#8217;s net worth is also referred to as <span data-type="term">bank capital</span>. A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called &#8220;reserves&#8221;), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.</p>

<p id="fs-idp58024400"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under &#8220;Assets&#8221; and &#8220;Liabilities,&#8221; it is sometimes called a <span data-type="term">T-account</span>.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank </div>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idp88978256" data-alt="The assets on the left side of the T-account are as follows: loans ($5 million), U.S. Government Securities (USGS) ($4 million) and Reserves ($2 million). The assets on the left side of the T-account are Loans ($5 million), U.S. Government Securities (USGS) ($4 million) and Reserves ($2 million). The liabilities + net worth on the right side of the T-account are as follows: deposits ($10 million) and net worth ($1 million). There is nothing in the space across from U.S. Government Securities (USGS).">

The liabilities + net worth on the right side of the T-account are as follows: deposits ($10 million) and net worth ($1 million). There is nothing in the space across from U.S. Government Securities (USGS)."></img>

</figure>
<p id="fs-idm115921136">The &#8220;T&#8221; in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that either the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank&#8212;like loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank. Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank&#8217;s T-account, assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.</p><p id="fs-idp49211072">When bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.</p><p id="fs-idp22092592">Loans are the first category of bank assets shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank&#8217;s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to the bank over time. But in practical terms, how can the value of the mortgage loan that is being paid over 30 years be measured in the present? One way of measuring the value of something&#8212;whether a loan or anything else&#8212;is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">loan market</span>, while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market.</p><p id="fs-idm5220656">One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the secondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the characteristics of the borrower, such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid? The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid, the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan.
Another key factor is to compare the interest rate charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan made at some point in the past requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they were sold to other financial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.</p>

<p id="fs-idm42442016">The second category of bank asset is <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">bonds</span>, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the federal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds&#8212;typically bonds issued by the U.S. government. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.</p><p id="fs-idm47113248">The final entry under assets is <span data-type="term">reserves</span>, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds&#8212;and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors&#8217; money on &#8220;reserve,&#8221; which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank. This is called a reserve requirement. (<a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2" class="target-chapter">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a> will explain how the level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.</p><p id="fs-idp103674656">The net worth of a bank is defined as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp26710336" class="note economics linkup"><p id="fs-idp71873440">For some concrete examples of what banks do, watch this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/makingsense">video</a> from Paul Solman&#8217;s &#8220;Making Sense of Financial News.&#8221;</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm21691232"><h1 data-type="title">How Banks Go Bankrupt</h1>
<p id="fs-idm114692480">A bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities. How can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.</p>
<p id="fs-idp32291504">A well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the expenses of banks every year includes a factor for loans that are not repaid, and the value of a bank&#8217;s loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some loans will not be repaid. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idm55573248" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What led to the financial crisis of 2008&#8211;2009?</div><p id="fs-idp61308176">Many banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are &#8220;securitized,&#8221; which means that they are bundled together into a financial security that is sold to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the security.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51366176"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Securitization</span> offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments. But if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid being exposed to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own &#8220;bonds.&#8221; In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank does not need to have lots of extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can be pooled into a financial security.</p><p id="fs-idp179263264">But securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank is going to hold a mortgage loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the loan is likely to be repaid. However, a bank that is going to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more willing to make what are called &#8220;subprime loans,&#8221; which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that. Some <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">subprime loans</span> made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans:  loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.</p><p id="fs-idp173011520">These subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities&#8212;but with a twist. The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the first, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or 30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p id="fs-idp137441984">The economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. But as housing prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could end up being worth much less than they had expected&#8212;and so the banks were staring bankruptcy in the face. In the 2008&#8211;2011 period, 318 banks failed in the United States.</p>
</div><p id="fs-idm87739440">The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank&#8217;s liabilities, namely the deposits of its customers, can be withdrawn quickly, but many of the bank&#8217;s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades.This <span data-type="term">asset-liability time mismatch</span>&#8212;a bank&#8217;s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term&#8212;can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that were made at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.</p><p id="fs-idm60560256">How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to <span data-type="term">diversify</span> its loans, which means lending to a variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market&#8212;say, making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to random chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.</p><p id="fs-idm103875584">Along with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan market, as described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because a higher share of loans will not be repaid in tough economic times.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm5895600" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm41008304">Banks facilitate the use of money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts when selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or being paid, and when saving money or receiving a loan. In the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they operate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet (sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another column. The liabilities of a bank are its deposits. The assets of a bank include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its reserves (which are not loaned out). The net worth of a bank is calculated by subtracting the bank&#8217;s liabilities from its assets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can decline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low rate of interest on its long-term loans but must pay the currently higher market rate of interest to attract depositors. Banks can protect themselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of banks&#8217; lending money, those loans being re-deposited in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create money in the economy.</p>

<p id="fs-idm97044912">Banks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. The banking system can literally create money through the process of making loans. Let&#8217;s see how.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp41750032"><h1 data-type="title">Money Creation by a Single Bank</h1>
<p id="fs-idp71581536">Start with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">Singleton Bank&#8217;s Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits </div>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm101945056" data-alt="The assets are reserves ($10 million). The liabilities + net worth are deposits ($10 million).">
<img src="../resources/e3858fa7a5c345dafc17c958de5221b4c88e492a" data-media-type="image/jpg" alt="The assets are reserves ($10 million). The liabilities + net worth are deposits ($10 million)."></img>
</span>
</figure>

<p id="fs-idm1702480">Singleton Bank is required by the Federal Reserve to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26667440">This change in business plan alters Singleton Bank&#8217;s balance sheet, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Singleton&#8217;s assets have changed; it now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank&#8217;s Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still has $10 million in deposits.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">Singleton Bank&#8217;s Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans </div>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-idm68693616" data-alt="The assets are reserves ($1 million) and loan to hank&#8217;s auto supply ($9 million). The liabilities + net worth are deposits ($10 million).">

</span>
</figure>

<p id="fs-idp50071312">Singleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank&#8217;s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that a loan has been made. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer is not going to let Hank walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank&#8217;s Auto Supply a cashier&#8217;s check for the $9 million.  Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves but is free to loan out the rest</p>

<p id="fs-idm2910832">Making loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which  can be easily used as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services.  Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National.  Obviously these deposits will be drawn down as Hank&#8217;s Auto Supply writes checks to pay its bills.  But the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in reserves to meet its liabilities; the rest the bank loans out.  In this example so far, bank lending has expanded the money supply by $9 million.</p>
<p id="fs-idp101495136">Now, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1 million) in a loan to Jack&#8217;s Chevy Dealership as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C27_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">First National Balance Sheet </div>

<p id="fs-idm38652448">If Jack&#8217;s deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an additional $8.1 million, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C27_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>  shows.</p>

<p id="fs-idm142735552">How is this money creation possible?  It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm88707968"><h1 data-type="title">The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System</h1>
<p id="fs-idm29505200">In a system with multiple banks, the initial excess reserve amount that Singleton Bank decided to lend to Hank&#8217;s Auto Supply was deposited into Frist National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money supply will expand.
In a multi-bank system, the amount of money that the system can create is found by using the money multiplier. The money multiplier tells us by how many times a loan will be &#8220;multiplied&#8221; as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.</p>
<p id="fs-idm43712032">Fortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The <span data-type="term">money multiplier formula</span> is:</p>

See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier calculation.</p>

<p id="fs-idm2973344">Using the money multiplier for the example in this text:</p>
<p id="fs-idp88764928">Step 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.</p>
<p id="fs-idm45440944">Step 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the total change in the M1 money supply:</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp9084608"><h1 data-type="title">Cautions about the Money Multiplier</h1>
<p id="fs-idp47413856">The money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that banks are required to hold by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that loans are less likely to be repaid when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as <a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2" class="target-chapter">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a> will discuss.</p><p id="fs-idp15860448">The process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. Indeed, all of the money in the economy, except for the original reserves, is a result of bank loans that are re-deposited and loaned out, again, and again.</p>
<p id="fs-idm590368">Finally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Indeed, central banks have an incentive to assure that bank deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as &#8220;mattress savings,&#8221; or money that people are hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity of money and loans in such an economy will decline.</p>

<p id="fs-idm23754000">Money and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the alternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets. Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the process of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.</p>
<p id="fs-idm75289280">But the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some possible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline in the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of the economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car manufacturing. The Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 illustrated this pattern.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm44902736" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bit Coins </div>
<p id="fs-idm15878032">The global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases, the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.</p><p id="fs-idm88806448">The latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat money is the Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows users to buy goods and services online. Products and services such as videos and books may be purchased using Bitcoins. It is not backed by any commodity nor has it been decreed by any government as legal tender, yet it used as a medium of exchange and its value (online at least) can be stored. It is also unregulated by any central bank, but is created online through people solving very complicated mathematics problems and getting paid afterward. Bitcoin.org is an information source if you are curious. Bitcoins are a relatively new type of money. At present, because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country nor regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal trading activities as well as legal ones. As technology increases and the need to reduce transactions costs associated with using traditional forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency may replace our dollar bill, just as the cowrie shell was replaced.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp113385408" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm69927536">The money multiplier is defined as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of bank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the quantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. Much of the money in an economy is created by the network of banks making loans, people making deposits, and banks making more loans.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm93457376" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound</div>
<p id="fs-idm138448704">Most economists believe that monetary policy (the manipulation of interest rates and credit conditions by a nation&#8217;s central bank) has a powerful influence on a nation&#8217;s economy. Monetary policy works when the central bank reduces interest rates and makes credit more available. As a result, business investment and other types of spending increase, causing GDP and employment to grow.</p>
<p id="fs-idp31020624">But what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already? They cannot be made negative, can they? That would mean that lenders pay borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the situation the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in at the end of the 2008&#8211;2009 recession. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its monetary policy, was slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%.</p>
<p id="fs-idm79438784">The Federal Reserve&#8217;s situation was further complicated because fiscal policy, the other major tool for managing the economy, was constrained by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt were already too high. What were the Federal Reserve&#8217;s options? How could monetary policy be used to stimulate the economy? The answer, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the game.</p>
    </div>















<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm75858032" class="note economics chapter-objectives"><div data-type="title" class="title">Introduction to Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</div>
    <p id="fs-idm100242240">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
    <ul id="fs-idm30198304">
      <li>The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks</li>
      <li>Bank Regulation</li>
      <li>How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy</li>
      <li>Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes</li>
      <li>Pitfalls for Monetary Policy</li>
    </ul>
  </div>















<p id="fs-idm91074784">Money, loans, and banks are all tied together. Money is deposited in bank accounts, which is then loaned to businesses, individuals, and other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks works well, economic transactions are made smoothly in goods and labor markets and savers are connected with borrowers. If the money and banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall into recession or suffer prolonged inflation.</p>







<p id="fs-idm22976048">The government of every country has public policies that support the system of money, loans, and banking. But these policies do not always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works and what may prevent it from working perfectly.</p>

<p id="fs-idm25613744">In making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lower <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interest rates</span> and, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment</span> and low <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation</span>. The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation&#8217;s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>







<p id="fs-idm1575376">The organization responsible for conducting <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">monetary policy</span> and ensuring that a nation&#8217;s financial system operates smoothly is called the <span data-type="term">central bank</span>. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, the central bank is called the Federal Reserve&#8212;often abbreviated as just &#8220;the Fed.&#8221; This section explains the organization of the U.S. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve</span> and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm168389712"><h1 data-type="title">Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve</h1>
<p id="fs-idm27697120">Unlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from political pressure so that policy decisions can be made based only on their economic merits. Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from politics. Policy decisions of the Fed do not require congressional approval, and the President cannot ask for the resignation of a Federal Reserve Governor as the President can with cabinet positions.</p>
<p id="fs-idm103833152">One member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The current Chair, Janet Yellen, has made many headlines already. Why? See the following Clear It Up feature to find out.</p>

<p id="fs-idm44203312">What individual can make financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In early 2014, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Janet L. Yellen</span>, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> became the first woman to hold this post. Yellen has been described in the media as &#8220;perhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history.&#8221; With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University, Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley. From 2004&#8211;2010, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Not an ivory tower economist, Yellen became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble in the housing market, more than two years before the financial crisis occurred. Yellen served on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent two years as Chair of the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors. If experience and credentials mean anything, Yellen is likely to be an effective Fed chair.</p></div>
<p id="fs-idp153883872">The Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While he or she has only one vote, the Chair controls the agenda, and is the public voice of the Fed, so he or she has more power and influence than one might expect.</p>

<p id="fs-idp138721072">The Federal Reserve is more than the Board of Governors.

The Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located are shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm93808432"><h1 data-type="title">What Does a Central Bank Do?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp89554272">The Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:
    </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="fs-idm34114976" data-number-style="arabic"><div data-type="item">To conduct monetary policy</div>
      <div data-type="item">To promote stability of the financial system</div>
      <div data-type="item">To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide banking services to the federal government.</div>
    </div>

<p id="fs-idm16112992">The first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules; the third function we will discuss here.</p>
<p id="fs-idm4592000">The Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the &#8220;discount window&#8221; facility, which will be discussed in more detail later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the physical check (or an image of that actual check) is returned to your bank, after which funds are transferred from your bank account to the account of the grocery store. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.</p>
<p id="fs-idm18572304">On a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.</p>
<p id="fs-idp22306672">Finally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses and how those loans are distributed geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp78185216" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm98150320">The most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest rates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy. Some prominent central banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England.</p>

<p id="fs-idp50581088">A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve</span>. The goal is not only to protect individuals&#8217; savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008&#8211;2009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of what a failure of the payments/financial system is like.</p>







<p id="fs-idp135645936"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bank regulation</span> is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make. In <a href="/contents/d293069d-90f9-4fdc-a303-7111f235f13d@4" class="target-chapter">Money and Banking</a>, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reserves</span>. &#8220;On hand&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank&#8217;s account at the Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions on the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks. They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.</p><p id="fs-idp132344400"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bank capital</span> is the difference between a bank&#8217;s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank&#8217;s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">net worth</span>. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm19235888"><h1 data-type="title">Bank Supervision</h1>
<p id="fs-idp125515856">Several government agencies monitor the balance sheets of banks to make sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan institutions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp67367168">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)</span> supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members. There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy, though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks.</p><p id="fs-idp38181408">The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses are called &#8220;bank holding companies.&#8221; While other regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding companies.</p>
<p id="fs-idp120322240">When the supervision of banks (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its behavior&#8212;or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to be closed or sold to a financially healthy bank.</p>
<p id="fs-idp152393120">Bank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank&#8217;s assets is not always straightforward. As discussed in <a href="/contents/d293069d-90f9-4fdc-a303-7111f235f13d@4" class="target-chapter">Money and Banking</a>, a bank&#8217;s <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">assets</span> are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.</p><p id="fs-idm33716288">The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.</p>
<p id="fs-idp63523888">For example, many observers have pointed out that Japan&#8217;s banks were in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.</p>
<p id="fs-idp77253552">In the United States, laws were passed in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public, and that they act as soon as a problem is identified. However, as many U.S. banks were staggered by the recession of 2008&#8211;2009, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the regulators had not foreseen the financial shakiness of the banks earlier, before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp52569424"><h1 data-type="title">Bank Runs</h1>
<p id="fs-idp106314272">Back in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank&#8217;s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money. Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is called a <span data-type="term">bank run</span>. In the movie <em data-effect="italics">It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em>, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits&#8212;using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C28_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Run on the Bank </div><figcaption>Bank runs during the Great Depression only served to worsen the economic situation. (Credit: National Archives and Records Administration)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp126864096" data-alt="This image is a photograph of people lining up outside of a bank in hopes of withdrawing their funds during the Great Depression.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp195008176">The risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank&#8217;s available cash. When the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession&#8212;but they could make a recession much worse.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm46677104"><h1 data-type="title">Deposit Insurance</h1>
<p id="fs-idm5876992">To protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place: <span data-type="term">deposit insurance</span> and the lender of last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</span> is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC. The insurance premium is based on the bank&#8217;s level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank&#8217;s financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10&#8211;20 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have paid 50&#8211;60 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.</p>
<p id="fs-idp71474800">Bank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the balance sheets of banks, looking at the value of assets and liabilities, to determine the level of riskiness. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 6,509 banks (as of the end of 2014). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many businesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm33553984"><h1 data-type="title">Lender of Last Resort</h1>
<p id="fs-idp2354000">The problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the <span data-type="term">lender of last resort</span> role. For banks, the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51456176">The lender of last resort task can come up in other financial crises, as well. During the panic of the stock market crash in 1987, when the value of U.S. stocks fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the recession of 2008&#8211;2009, the &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; policies (discussed below) of the Federal Reserve can be interpreted as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp377200" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm35545968">A bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of having negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it someplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth, their deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects deposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their assets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank supervision.</p>
<p id="fs-idm2752">When a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes short-term loans available in situations of severe financial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many banks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination of deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the banking system from causing recessions.</p>

<p id="fs-idp61599296">In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a &#8220;bank for banks&#8221;&#8212;that is, each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm10687584"><h1 data-type="title">Open Market Operations</h1>
<p id="fs-idm102026656">The most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is <span data-type="term">open market operations</span>. Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate charged by commercial banks making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate, but one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.</p>
<p id="fs-idm105083904">
The <span data-type="term">Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</span> makes the decisions regarding these open market operations. The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting members who are drawn, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York district president is a permanent voting member of the FOMC and the other four spots are filled on a rotating, annual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the chairman of the Federal Reserve has traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used tool of monetary policy.</p>

<p id="fs-idp16633712">To understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in
<a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank&#8217;s reserves rise by $20 million, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves that it started with in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c). The open market operation by the central bank causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier discussed in <a href="/contents/d293069d-90f9-4fdc-a303-7111f235f13d@4" class="target-chapter">Money and Banking</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C28_014"><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm79154128" data-alt="The figure shows 3 t-accounts.

  </figure><p id="fs-idp14289264">Where did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">bonds</span>? A central bank has the power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air&#8212;or with a few clicks on some computer keys.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50939632">Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now holds an additional $30 million in bonds, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring its reserves back to the desired level, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_015" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c). In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier discussed in <a href="/contents/d293069d-90f9-4fdc-a303-7111f235f13d@4" class="target-chapter">Money and Banking</a> takes effect.

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm4457488" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?</div>
<p id="fs-idp3919424">Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being <em data-effect="italics">outside</em> the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the supply of money in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank&#8212;reducing the quantity of money in the economy.</p>     </div>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp46576240"><h1 data-type="title">Changing Reserve Requirements</h1>
<p id="fs-idp53258912">A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the <span data-type="term">reserve requirement</span>, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank&#8217;s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reserves</span>, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.</p>
<p id="fs-idm11448032">In early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million in deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount above $103.6 million. Small changes in the reserve requirements are made almost every year. For example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. In practice, large changes in reserve requirements are rarely used to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be extremely disruptive and difficult to comply with, while loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks being unable to meet the demand for withdrawals.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm64695696"><h1 data-type="title">Changing the Discount Rate</h1>
<p id="fs-idm5421840">The Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the Financial Panic of 1907 when many banks failed as a result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was founded to be the &#8220;lender of last resort.&#8221; In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed&#8217;s discount &#8220;window&#8221; to quell the bank run. The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the <span data-type="term">discount rate</span>. (They are so named because loans are made against the bank&#8217;s outstanding loans &#8220;at a discount&#8221; of their face value.) Once depositors became convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm99068448">So, the third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.</p>
<p id="fs-idm32582496">In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by Fed&#8217;s charging a higher discount rate, than the federal funds rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm58967824">In the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase &#8220;...to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper&#8221; is contained in its long title. This tool was seen as the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do so.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp33312400" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idp45378400">A central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, which involves buying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. The most commonly used tool is open market operations.</p>

<p id="fs-idp58079680">A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an <span data-type="term">expansionary monetary policy</span> or <span data-type="term">loose monetary policy</span>.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm78734896"><h1 data-type="title">The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm54023136">Consider the market for loanable bank funds, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to S<sub>1</sub>, leading to an equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) with a lower interest rate of 6% and a quantity of funds loaned of $14 billion. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to S<sub>2</sub>, leading to an equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) with a higher interest rate of 10% and a quantity of funds loaned of $8 billion.</p>

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idm96661744">So how does a central bank &#8220;raise&#8221; interest rates? When describing the monetary policy actions taken by a central bank, it is common to hear that the central bank &#8220;raised interest rates&#8221; or &#8220;lowered interest rates.&#8221; We need to be clear about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, interest rates change, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. If they do not meet the Fed&#8217;s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.</p>
<p id="fs-idm115376560">Recall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the <span data-type="term">federal funds rate</span>. The Federal Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.</p>
<p id="fs-idm2170128">Of course, financial markets display a wide range of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interest rates</span>, representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate&#8212;which remember is for borrowing overnight&#8212;will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the specific interest rates are set by the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and borrowing.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp98596512"><h1 data-type="title">The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand</h1>
<p id="fs-idp9333792">Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several components of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.</p>
<p id="fs-idp162497616">If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span>, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP. <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Keynesian aggregate supply curve</span> (SRAS). The original equilibrium during a recession of E<sub>0</sub> occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) to shift right to AD<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.</p><figure id="CNX_Econv1-2_C28_08"><div data-type="title" class="title">Expansionary or Contractionary Monetary Policy </div><figcaption>(a) The economy is originally in a recession with the equilibrium output and price level shown at E<sub>0</sub>. Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift aggregate demand to the right from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, leading to the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) at the potential GDP level of output with a relatively small rise in the price level. (b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP level of output at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level. Contractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, thus leading to a new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) at the potential GDP level of output.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp97363200" data-alt="The graph showing how changes in the money supply can restore output levels to potential GDP in times of economic instability.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp95125824">Conversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level.

A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the original demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) to shift left to AD<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.</p><p id="fs-idp45680144">These examples suggest that monetary policy should be <span data-type="term">countercyclical</span>; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy to changes in output and the price level.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp1628816"><h1 data-type="title">Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades</h1>
<p id="fs-idm72864">For the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, Federal Reserve monetary policy can largely be summed up by looking at how it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.</p>
<p id="fs-idm5200">Of course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that the central bank should be considered one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As noted earlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the chairperson of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p id="fs-idp9023376"><a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest rate is set through open market operations), the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment rate</span>, and the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation rate</span> since 1975. Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econv1-2_C28_10"><div data-type="title" class="title">Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Inflation </div><figcaption>Through the episodes shown here, the Federal Reserve typically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp661936" data-alt="This graph shows the historical rate of inflation, unemployment and the federal funds interest rate during periods of recession.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idm547328"><strong data-effect="bold">Episode 1</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm546576">Consider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so the Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981&#8211;1982, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.</p>
<p id="fs-idm24176"><strong data-effect="bold">Episode 2</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp135520">In Episode 2, when the Federal Reserve was persuaded in the early 1980s that inflation was declining, the Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4% in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come down to 7%, and was still falling.</p>
<p id="fs-idp9116752"><strong data-effect="bold">Episode 3</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp9117504">However, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the recession of 1990&#8211;1991, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.</p>
<p id="fs-idp9117888"><strong data-effect="bold">Episode 4</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp725360">In Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control, it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.</p>
<p id="fs-idp9140752"><strong data-effect="bold">Episodes 5 and 6</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp9141504">In Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.</p>
<p id="fs-idp738720"><strong data-effect="bold">Episodes 7 and 8</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm27328">In Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of Japan-style deflation; this persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5% by 2007.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26368"><strong data-effect="bold">Episode 9</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm158640">In Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to near-zero by December 2008, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think &#8220;outside the box.&#8221;</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp9045664"><h1 data-type="title">Quantitative Easing</h1>
<p id="fs-idp9046176">The most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy&#8212;open market operations&#8212;works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as <span data-type="term">quantitative easing (QE)</span>. This is the purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp652736">Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed purchasing long term <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Treasury bonds</span>, rather than short term <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Treasury bills</span>. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Bernanke sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.
</p><p id="fs-idp667280">This leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done before. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed &#8220;toxic assets,&#8221; because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing possibly &#8220;toxic assets&#8221; from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen the financial system.</p>
<p id="fs-idp647360">Quantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:
      </p><div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="fs-idp60976" data-number-style="arabic"><div data-type="item">During QE<sub>1</sub>, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</div>
        <div data-type="item">In November 2010, the Fed began QE<sub>2</sub>, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.</div>
        <div data-type="item">QE<sub>3</sub>, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion purchase of bonds, ending Quantitative Easing. </div>
      </div>
<p id="fs-idp126048">The quantitative easing policies adopted by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world) are usually thought of as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are, indeed, to be temporary, then the Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE<sub>1</sub> was somewhat successful, but that QE<sub>2</sub> and QE<sub>3</sub> have been less so.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp8984592" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
 <p id="fs-idp8985472">An expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise would have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession. A contractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit below what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the 2008&#8211;2009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of credit.</p>

<p id="fs-idp7647456">In the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">central bank</span> must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.</p>







<p id="fs-idp433616">As a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future; instead, its primary effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp33604816"><h1 data-type="title">Excess Reserves</h1>
<p id="fs-idp81377104">Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding additional <span data-type="term">excess reserves</span> above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans.</p>
<p id="fs-idm43462128">When many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span>, because they recognize that firms&#8217; sales and employees&#8217; jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp81069616">Japan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan&#8217;s economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the money supply of the country by about 50%&#8212;an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan&#8217;s economy continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp84692480" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Should monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?</div>
<p id="fs-idp76150864">Should monetary policy be conducted by a nation&#8217;s Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives? Or should it be conducted by a politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters? Here are some of the arguments made by each side.</p>
<p id="fs-idp7939024"><em data-effect="italics">The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy</em></p>
<p id="fs-idp85348880">Elected representatives conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle monetary policy in the same way. Sure, they will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is better to have mistakes made by elected officials accountable to voters than by political appointees. After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve&#8212;and to most central banks around the world&#8212;are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idp50453696"><em data-effect="italics">The Case for an Independent Central Bank</em> </p>
<p id="fs-idp43911792">Because the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and be signed into law, but monetary policy decisions can be made much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.</p>
    </div>
<p id="fs-idp8477216">The problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However, when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. This analogy should not be taken too literally&#8212;expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan&#8217;s economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp108933952"><h1 data-type="title">Unpredictable Movements of Velocity</h1><p id="fs-idp120217808">Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. The <span data-type="term">velocity</span> of money in a year is defined as:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp27763056">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Velocity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>nominal&#160;GDP</mtext><mtext>money&#160;supply</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Velocity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>nominal&#160;GDP</mtext><mtext>money&#160;supply</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idp129550576">Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used. Consider the velocity of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">M1</span>, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was $1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ($14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year; a lower velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.</p>
<p id="fs-idp101875056">Perhaps you heard the &#8220;d&#8221; word mentioned during our recent economic downturn. See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp53473568" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What happens during episodes of deflation?</div>
<p id="fs-idp111366880"><span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Deflation</span> occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession.</p>
<p id="fs-idp166665632">Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">nominal interest rate</span> is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and there is <em data-effect="italics">deflation</em> of 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where an unexpectedly high number of loans are not repaid, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When banks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which can lead to recession.</p>
<p id="fs-idp6287984">Then the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero&#8212;but the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.</p>
<p id="fs-idp129033200">In the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930&#8211;1933, which caused many borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example, experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999&#8211;2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. Indeed, there is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from 1876&#8211;1900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional severe recessions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp172318016">The central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.</p>
    </div>
<p id="fs-idm73105584">Changes in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp13823680"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Money&#160;supply&#160;&#215;&#160;velocity&#160;=&#160;Nominal&#160;GDP</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>Money&#160;supply&#160;&#215;&#160;velocity&#160;=&#160;Nominal&#160;GDP</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>

<p id="eip-id1168278738018">Recall from <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> that</p><div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="eip-id1168278898840"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) x Real GDP.</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) x Real GDP.</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>

<p id="fs-idm76022928">This equation is sometimes called the <span data-type="term">basic quantity equation of money</span> but, as you can see, it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition.</p>
<p id="fs-idm139942528">If velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">nominal GDP</span>&#8212;although this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">real GDP</span>, or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.</p>
<p id="fs-idm118722928">The actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most common definition of the money supply, is illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_11" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how money is used in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal borrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">M2</span> is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econv1-2_C28_11"><div data-type="title" class="title">Velocity Calculated Using M1 </div><figcaption>Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given year. Different measures of velocity can be calculated by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm76372016" data-alt="This graph shows the velocity of money increasing over time.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idm125181904">In the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Milton Friedman</span> (1912&#8211;2006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady rate of monetary growth would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real economy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: &#8220;The first and most important lesson that history teaches about what monetary policy can do&#8212;and it is a lesson of the most profound importance&#8212;is that monetary policy can prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp37215232">As the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.</p>
</section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm31056528"><h1 data-type="title">Unemployment and Inflation</h1>
<p id="fs-idm82678640">If you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">neoclassical model</span> of the economy, the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C28_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. In the neoclassical model, the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) is determined by real economic factors. If the original level of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span> is AD<sub>0</sub>, then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD<sub>1</sub> only creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation&#8212;and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C28_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model </div><figcaption>In a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the price level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate demand to shift from the original AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>. However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>, but has no effect in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of output in this model.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm133101296" data-alt="This graph shows the neo-classical view that in the long run, monetary policy only affects the price level, not output.">

    </span>

  </figure><p id="fs-idp59740704">This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice <span data-type="term">inflation targeting</span>, which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve</span> in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.</p><p id="fs-idp118337584">Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy&#8212;even if the economy is already producing at <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">potential GDP</span>. In some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons&#8212;long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic goals&#8212;monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp197515408"><h1 data-type="title">Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles</h1>
<p id="fs-idp177908240">One long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the &#8220;dot-com&#8221; boom, the U.S. stock market, which is measured by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dow Jones</span> Industrial Index (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nasdaq</span> index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Indeed, stock values as measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values contributed to the recession of 2001 and the higher unemployment that followed.</p>
<p id="fs-idp42534240">A similar story can be told about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the &#8220;housing bubble&#8221; from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. When the price of housing fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.</p>
<p id="fs-idp52482080">
At a broader level, some economists worry about a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">leverage cycle</span>, where &#8220;leverage&#8221; is a term used by financial economists to mean &#8220;borrowing.&#8221; When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">money multiplier</span>&#8212;a process of loans being made, money being deposited, and more loans being made. In good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of certain assets&#8212;like stock prices or housing prices&#8212;to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.</p>
<p id="fs-idp169318352">Thus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising &#8220;too fast&#8221; or in 2004 that housing prices were rising &#8220;too fast,&#8221; and then taken action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.</p>
<p id="fs-idp52934464">Let&#8217;s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed&#8212;or any central bank&#8212;would stir up the economy by increasing the money supply.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm124315312" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Calculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus</div>
<p id="fs-idm83489088">Suppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?</p>
<p id="fs-idm75994192">Step 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:</p>

<p id="fs-idm100511536">Step 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.</p>

<p id="fs-idp145260208">In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near zero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower short term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called &#8220;zero bound problem,&#8221; prompted the Fed, under then Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By early 2014, quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy&#8217;s recovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this module.  The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation.  As of early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm132262144">Monetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a) the effects occur only after long and variable lags; (b) if banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and (c) velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy. Some central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of the central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession, whichever goal seems most important at the time.</p>

Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the U.S. economy?</p>
<p id="fs-idp12495808">We live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth of imported goods and services each year, not just from the European Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of dollars&#8217; worth of exports. U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major buyer of U.S. federal debt.</p>
<p id="fs-idm47316960">Many people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it&#8217;s an indication of a weak economy. But is it? This chapter will help answer that question.</p>

<p id="fs-idm41774256">The world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan afghani and the Albanian lek all the way through the alphabet to the Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for another. Perhaps the need for exchanging currencies will come from a German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to exchange the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its workers and suppliers in Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to make the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza. Perhaps it will be an American tourist visiting China, who wishes to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.</p>















<p id="fs-idm30498736">Exchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the United Kingdom the pound was worth $2 in U.S. currency in spring 2008, but was worth only $1.40 in U.S. currency six months later. For firms engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these swings in exchange rates can have an enormous effect on profits.</p>







<p id="fs-idm41763712">This chapter discusses the international dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate. An <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exchange rate</span> is nothing more than a price&#8212;that is, the price of one currency in terms of another currency&#8212;and so they can be analyzed with the tools of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">supply</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand</span>. The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets: their size, their main participants, and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following module uses demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final module then brings the central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country must decide whether to allow its exchange rate to be determined in the market, or have the central bank intervene in the exchange rate market. All the choices for exchange rate policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.</p>

<p id="fs-idm16197792">Most countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to <span data-type="term">dollarize</span>&#8212;that is, to use the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common currency is the decision by 17 European nations&#8212;including some very large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy&#8212;to replace their former currencies with the euro. With these exceptions duly noted, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring, borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. The market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the <span data-type="term">foreign exchange market</span>.</p>







<p id="fs-idm58490032">You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters. In <a href="/contents/1f4933b1-1d91-4e34-a416-0c0d4608f64a" class="target-chapter">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>, for example, we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP</span> statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies. These earlier examples, however, took the actual exchange rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the exchange rate is a price&#8212;the price of one currency expressed in terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing prices, whether in this course, any other economics course, in public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and demand in markets.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp66153680" class="note economics linkup">

<p id="fs-idm13344352">The quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking. A survey done in April, 2013 by the Bank of International Settlements, an international organization for banks and the financial industry, found that $5.3 trillion <em data-effect="italics">per day</em> was traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was $15.8 trillion <em data-effect="italics">per year</em>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp32765504"><a href="#Table_29_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm77971184"><h1 data-type="title">Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets</h1>
<p id="fs-idm132859728">In foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency&#8212;and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">firms</span> that are involved in international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors buying ownership (or part-ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership. Let&#8217;s consider these categories in turn.</p>
<p id="fs-idm68759456">Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. So, a Chinese firm exporting abroad will earn some other currency&#8212;say, U.S. dollars&#8212;but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.</p>
<p id="fs-idm12565488">International tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.</p>
<p id="fs-idm29486368">Financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency, are often divided into two categories. <span data-type="term">Foreign direct investment (FDI)</span> refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase of a U.S. firm, InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.</p>
<p id="fs-idm7832784">The other kind of international financial investment, <span data-type="term">portfolio investment</span>, involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.</p>
<p id="fs-idm73312464">Portfolio investment is often linked to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing bonds issued in the United Kingdom. For simplicity, ignore any interest paid by the bond (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British pound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_020" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is indeed worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600&#8212;a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_020" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), that investor could start off with &#163;20,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately &#163;21,429 in British currency&#8212;again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.</p>

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm18138240">Many portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the value of the currency will change in one direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. But you do not know how much this contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let&#8217;s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can <span data-type="term">hedge</span>, which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now&#8212;regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for nothing. But if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. Financial contracts like hedging, where parties wish to be protected against exchange rate movements, also commonly lead to a series of portfolio investments by the firm that is receiving a fee to provide the hedge.</p><p id="fs-idm13867984">Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment less than ten percent of a company is purchased. As such, portfolio investment is often made with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment more than ten percent of a company is purchased and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility; thus foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus. As a practical matter, portfolio investments can be withdrawn from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom can do so with a phone call or a few clicks of a computer key. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. <a href="#Table_29_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> summarizes the main categories of demanders and suppliers of currency.</p>

<table id="Table_29_02" summary="This table has two columns and five rows. The first row is a header row, and it labels the columns &#8220;Demand for the U.S. Dollar Comes from...&#8221; and &#8220;Supply of the U.S. Dollar Comes from...&#8221;.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp9459312"><h1 data-type="title">Participants in the Exchange Rate Market</h1>
<p id="fs-idm13351488">The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other out. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels.</p>
<p id="fs-idp45335712">Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">dealers</span>, then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interbank market</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp27511472">In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all times.</p>
<p id="fs-idp8676416">The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are about 23% of global GDP; which is about $18 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $1.5 trillion in the end of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $5.3 trillion <em data-effect="italics">per day</em> being traded in foreign exchange markets. Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment&#8212;relatively short-term movements of financial capital between currencies&#8212;and because of the actions of the large foreign exchange dealers as they constantly buy and sell with each other.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm33544896"><h1 data-type="title">Strengthening and Weakening Currency</h1>
<p id="fs-idp25313072">When the prices of most goods and services change, the price is said to &#8220;rise&#8221; or &#8220;fall.&#8221; For exchange rates, the terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies, it is referred to as <span data-type="term">appreciating</span> or &#8220;strengthening.&#8221; When the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, it is referred to as <span data-type="term">depreciating</span> or &#8220;weakening.&#8221;</p><p id="fs-idm30716816">To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). The vertical axis in <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency, measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in 1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60 Canadian by early in 2002, fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline in 2009 and 2010. The units in which exchange rates are measured can be confusing, because the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is being measured using a different currency&#8212;the Canadian dollar. But exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by using a different currency.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03"><div data-type="title" class="title">Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or Depreciate </div><figcaption>Exchange rates tend to fluctuate substantially, even between bordering companies such as the United States and Canada.  By looking closely at the time values (the years vary slightly on these graphs), it is clear that the values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which demonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the appreciation of the other and vice versa.  This means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case, the United States and Canada), the depreciation (or weakening) of one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the appreciation (or strengthening) of the other currency (which in this example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)</span> (a) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS ; (b) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CCUSSP01CAQ650N)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm1000144" data-alt="The top graph shows the exchange rate from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars since 1980.

The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian dollars, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), is a perfect mirror image with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar measured in U.S. dollars, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b).

<p id="fs-idm2254416">With the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace through how different participants in the market will be affected by a stronger or weaker currency. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling imports in the U.S. economy); (3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.</p>

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm71696480">For a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the firm&#8217;s profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country&#8217;s exports.</p>
<p id="fs-idm42696096">Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export sales, when traded back into the home currency of the exporting firm, will now buy more of the home currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country&#8217;s level of imports.</p>
<p id="fs-idm8161376">For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country&#8217;s currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In January 2008, $1 bought 7 South African rand, so the tourist had 35,000 rand to spend. In January 2009, $1 bought 10 rand, so the tourist had 50,000 rand to spend. By January 2010, $1 bought only 7.5 rand. Clearly, 2009 was the year for U.S. tourists to visit South Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country&#8217;s currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10291104">A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.</p>
<p id="fs-idm23759424">However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.</p>
<p id="fs-idm62105136">The preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions are illustrated in the first column of <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The following Work It Out feature centers the analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm18645680" class="note economics workout"><div data-type="title" class="title">Effects of a Weaker Dollar</div>
<p id="fs-idm53391168">Let&#8217;s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.</p>
<p id="fs-idm38266144">Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 / $1.50 per British pound, or &#163;16,667. The dollar affects the price faced by foreigners who may purchase U.S. exports.</p>
<p id="fs-idm11720912">Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = &#163;12,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.</p>
<p id="fs-idm10380816">Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the opposite.</p>
<p id="fs-idm41960528">Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States. If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is &#163;6.00 and the exchange rate is $1.50 per British pound, the price for the grocery store is 6.00 &#215; $1.50 = $9.00 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 &#215; $2.00 = $12.</p>
<p id="fs-idm68962192">Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S. imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.</p>
<p id="fs-idm18226560">Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer&#8212;they are purchasing a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may choose not to travel at all.</p>
<p id="fs-idm39354272">Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.</p>
<p id="fs-idm102183968">Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer&#8212;they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the &#8220;price&#8221; of investment, since the same number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of U.S. investment abroad.</p>
<p id="fs-idm34279424">Step 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idm57865568">At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved in international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next module shows how the tools of demand and supply can be used in foreign exchange markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (&#8220;stronger&#8221; and &#8220;weaker&#8221; addressed more in the following Clear It Up feature).</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm64009424" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?</div>
<p id="fs-idm49044944">One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a &#8220;stronger&#8221; or &#8220;appreciating&#8221; currency must be better than a &#8220;weaker&#8221; or &#8220;depreciating&#8221; currency. After all, is it not obvious that &#8220;strong&#8221; is better than &#8220;weak&#8221;? But do not let the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.</p>

<p id="fs-idm44372192">In the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one currency to purchase another currency. The demand for dollars comes from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; and foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S. economy. On the supply side of the foreign exchange market for the trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in the U.S. economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S. investors seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When currency A can buy more of currency B, then currency A has strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy less of currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated relative to B. If currency A strengthens or appreciates relative to currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate with regard to currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who are buying with that currency and injures those who are selling. A weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with that currency and benefits those who are selling with it, like exporters.</p>

<li> The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro, so a British exporter will receive euros from export sales, which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will mean more pounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off. In addition, the lower price for German imports will stimulate demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger euro benefits the British exporter.</li>
<li> The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch tourist needs to turn euros into Chilean pesos. An increase in the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As a consequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive vacation than he planned, so the tourist will be better off.</li>
<li> The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase in the euro means it will buy more Canadian dollars. As a result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the Canadian bonds, so it may purchase more bonds. Either way, the Greek bank benefits.</li>
<li> Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in the euro, in terms of other currencies, should have no impact on the French exporter.</li>

The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">demand curve</span> (D) for Mexican pesos intersects with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">supply curve</span> (S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note that the two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per peso). In the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars. What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">equilibrium exchange rate</span>? The answer to this question is discussed in the following section.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm87470224"><h1 data-type="title">Expectations about Future Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm35308736">One reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the value of the currency is about to increase. One reason to supply a currency&#8212;that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market&#8212;is the expectation that the value of the currency is about to decline. For example, imagine that a leading business newspaper, like the <em data-effect="italics">Wall Street Journal</em> or the <em data-effect="italics">Financial Times</em>, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso will appreciate in value. The likely effects of such an article are illustrated in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Demand for the Mexican peso shifts to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates </div><figcaption>An announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the peso in the present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation. Similarly, it will make investors less likely to supply pesos to the foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the shift of supply to the left cause an immediate appreciation in the exchange rate.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm55874368" data-alt="The graph shows how supply and demand would change if the exchange rate for pesos was predicted to strengthen.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm14938320"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">foreign exchange market</span>, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers&#8212;that is, it affects both demand and supply for a currency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm92984160">The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction; in this example, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is a higher quantity. But in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.</p>
<p id="fs-idm57532992">This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few weeks or months. When investors expect a country&#8217;s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The appreciation of the currency can lead other investors to believe that future appreciation is likely&#8212;and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a currency <em data-effect="italics">might</em> weaken quickly leads to an <em data-effect="italics">actual</em> weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief that the currency is going to weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-reinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp40354544"><h1 data-type="title">Differences across Countries in Rates of Return</h1>
<p id="fs-idp28571696">The motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country look relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of return will shift demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than they previously did. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets and fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S. dollar will shift to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, and supply will shift to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5 billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation&#8217;s currency to appreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation&#8217;s currency to depreciate or weaken. Since a nation&#8217;s central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a central bank can also cause changes in exchange rates&#8212;a connection that will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest Rates </div><figcaption>A higher rate of return for U.S. dollars makes holding dollars more attractive. Thus, the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market shifts to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, while the supply of dollars shifts to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) has a stronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), but in this example, the equilibrium quantity traded does not change.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp9878720" data-alt="The graph shows how supply and demand would change if the U.S. dollar brought a higher rate of return.">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm75436704"><h1 data-type="title">Relative Inflation</h1>
<p id="fs-idm57778288">If a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the currency. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986&#8211;87, Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the purchasing power of the peso in Mexico, the exchange rate value of the peso declined as well. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, while supply of the peso increased from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to $0.50 per peso at the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange markets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_010"><div data-type="title" class="title">Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher Inflation </div><figcaption>If a currency is experiencing relatively high inflation, then its buying power is decreasing and international investors will be less eager to hold it. Thus, a rise in inflation in the Mexican peso would lead demand to shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, and supply to increase from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. Both movements in demand and supply would cause the currency to depreciate. The effect on the quantity traded is drawn here as a decrease, but in truth it could be an increase or no change, depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm72888640" data-alt="The graph shows how supply and demand would change if the pesos experienced inflation.">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm5139904"><h1 data-type="title">Purchasing Power Parity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm23713664">Over the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the buying power of the currency in terms of goods that are internationally traded. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded goods&#8212;such as oil, steel, computers, and cars&#8212;in one country than in another country, businesses would start buying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.</p>
<p id="fs-idm2176432">For example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.60 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United States should sell for $32,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada was much lower than $32,000, then at least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If the price of cars was much higher than $32,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known as <span data-type="term">arbitrage</span>, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It may occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.</p>
<p id="fs-idm47567200">The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the <span data-type="term">purchasing power parity (PPP)</span> exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison Program, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.</p>
<p id="fs-idm41331616">The purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. First, PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP</span> in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. But should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange rates bounce around. In summer 2008, the exchange rate was 108 yen/dollar, but in late 2009 the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen was 90 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan&#8217;s GDP was &#165;500 trillion in both 2008 and 2009. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan&#8217;s GDP will be $4.6 trillion in 2008 (that is, &#165;500 trillion /(&#165;108/dollar)) and $5.5 trillion in 2009 (that is, &#165;500 trillion /(&#165;90/dollar)).</p>
<p id="fs-idm101412384">Of course, it is not true that Japan&#8217;s economy increased enormously in 2009&#8212;in fact, Japan had a recession like much of the rest of the world. The misleading appearance of a booming Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market exchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.</p>
<p id="fs-idp6618256">The second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer and closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the short run and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the exchange rates will often move away from the PPP exchange rate for a time. But, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate relationships.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm83855968" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm44445216">In the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks, exchange rates are influenced by speculators who are trying to invest in currencies that will grow stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker. Such speculation can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads to a stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run, exchange rate markets are influenced by differences in rates of return. Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example, high interest rates) will tend to experience stronger currencies as they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low rates of return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as investors convert to other currencies.</p>
<p id="fs-idm41557856">In the medium run of a few months or a few years, exchange rate markets are influenced by inflation rates. Countries with relatively high inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency than countries with lower inflation, and thus currency depreciation. Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange rate such that the prices of internationally tradable goods in different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a common currency, are similar in all economies.</p>

<p id="fs-idm11209376">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">central bank</span> will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation&#8217;s banking system&#8211;this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country. Let&#8217;s discuss these scenarios in turn.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm14382592"><h1 data-type="title">Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply</h1>
<p id="fs-idm10120576">Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span> in the economy as a whole.</p>
<p id="fs-idm50471328">For example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.06/euro. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S. dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs &#8364;10 million in costs, and sells its products in the United States for $10 million. In 1999, when this firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million &#215; [&#8364;1/$1.06]), it received &#8364;9.4 million, and suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.37/euro (that is, $10 million &#215; [&#8364;1 euro/$1.37]), it received approximately &#8364;7.3 million and an even larger loss. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country. From the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exports</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-idm18103440">Since an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports means more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are &#8220;good&#8221; for the economy and imports are &#8220;bad,&#8221; but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for $20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has lost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and operate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and services, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves money by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp8164416"><h1 data-type="title">Fluctuations in Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp8165056">Exchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> earlier showed that even two economically developed neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in exchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on imported inputs to production, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade&#8212;which in many countries adds up to half or more of a nation&#8217;s GDP&#8212;sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to dramatic changes in profits and losses. So, a central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too much as part of providing a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not on reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p id="fs-idp8167696">One of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system. Most international loans are measured in a few large currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies, banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how this pattern of international borrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the dollars to its domestic currency&#8212;in the case of Thailand, the currency is the baht&#8212;at a rate of 40 baht/dollar. The bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank converts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_014"><div data-type="title" class="title">International Borrowing </div><figcaption>The scenario of international borrowing that ends on the left is a success story, but the scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the exchange rate weakens.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp5483008" data-alt="The chart shows two scenarios resulting from international borrowing.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp8153040">This process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_014" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates what happens when the baht unexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the bank. But because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars. (Of course, if the exchange rate had changed in the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)</p>
<p id="fs-idp8154912">In 1997&#8211;1998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">foreign investment capital</span>, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year through the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated, Argentina&#8217;s banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p id="fs-idp8157200">Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers. When most of a country&#8217;s largest banks become <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">bankrupt</span> simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country&#8217;s existing banks into bankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter on <a href="#m48731">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp14664048"><h1 data-type="title">Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm98754096">Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">international trade</span> and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. The country must also be concerned that rapid movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may cripple its export industries, while rapid movements from a strong to a weak exchange rate can cripple its banking sector. In short, every choice of an exchange rate&#8212;whether it should be stronger or weaker, or fixed or changing&#8212;represents potential tradeoffs.</p>

<p id="fs-idp18159424">A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several reasons. Exchange rates will affect imports and exports, and thus affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange rates may cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks. The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows of international financial capital.</p>

<p id="fs-idm33161360">This chapter has explained that &#8220;one of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system,&#8221; if banks borrow from abroad to lend domestically. Why is this less likely to be a problem for the U.S. banking system?</p>
</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm92722368">
<p id="fs-idp14849168">The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in domestic currency. Since banks&#8217; assets (loans they made) are in domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in foreign currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts grow larger. If the domestic currency falls substantially in value, as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking system could fail. This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to borrow dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in the global economy. Since both assets and debts are in dollars, a change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system failure the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.</p>

<p id="fs-idm41587856">A booming economy can attract financial capital inflows, which promote further growth. But capital can just as easily flow out of the country, leading to economic recession. Is a country whose economy is booming because it decided to stimulate consumer spending more or less likely to experience capital flight than an economy whose boom is caused by economic investment expenditure?</p>
</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idp7920720">
<p id="fs-idm67446944">While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to be able to generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that borrows to finance consumption. As a result, an investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital flight and economic recession.</p>

<p id="fs-idp12899216">Exchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_016" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>: let the foreign exchange market determine the exchange rate; let the market set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but have the central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too large; have the central bank guarantee a specific exchange rate; or share a currency with other countries. Let&#8217;s discuss each type of exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.</p>















<figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_016"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Spectrum of Exchange Rate Policies </div><figcaption>A nation may adopt one of a variety of exchange rate regimes, from floating rates in which the foreign exchange market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments intervene to manage the value of the exchange rate, to a common currency where the nation adopts the currency of another country or group of countries.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm800352" data-alt="The graph shows several options of exchange rate policies.">

</span>

</figure><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm1971808"><h1 data-type="title">Floating Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm24327856">A policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a <span data-type="term">floating exchange rate</span>. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world economy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.</p>
<p id="fs-idm24705424">Consider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103 yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1, 2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large movements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse. But even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent back and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the new exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C29_017"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese Yen </div><figcaption>Even seemingly stable exchange rates such as the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely looked at over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate between 2011 and 2013.  In 2013, there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen (relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about 14% and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14%.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm2144">However, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services rise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong productivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.</p>
<p id="fs-idm203056">Floating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable, then inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce around less, too. The economist <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Milton Friedman</span> (1912&#8211;2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book <em data-effect="italics">Capitalism and Freedom</em>:</p><p id="fs-idm24300320"></p><blockquote id="fs-idm50712880">Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system [for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices are free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly 	stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable.</blockquote><p id="fs-idm2428512">Advocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out, however, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp1827264"><h1 data-type="title">Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs</h1>
<p id="fs-idm65343424">When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced, it is said to have established a &#8220;peg&#8221; for its currency. A <span data-type="term">soft peg</span> is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market, but in some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will intervene in the market. With a <span data-type="term">hard peg</span> exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.</p>
<p id="fs-idm17150432">Suppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily quantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as shown at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). However, the government of Brazil decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. Perhaps it is an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange rate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it is minimizing fluctuations in the real by keeping it at this lower rate. Perhaps the target exchange rate was set sometime in the past, and is now being maintained for the sake of stability. Whatever the reason, if Brazil&#8217;s central bank wishes to keep the exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at this weaker exchange rate of 30 cents/real, the quantity demanded of its currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13 billion reals in the foreign exchange market.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idm38638016">The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">expansionary monetary policy</span> that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation. This technique is not often used because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the country&#8217;s monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil&#8217;s central bank could trade directly in the foreign exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase foreign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap between <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">quantity demanded</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">quantity supplied</span> of its currency.</p>
<p id="fs-idm35000080"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C29_024" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that that current market exchange rate is temporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.</p>
<p id="fs-idm68413936">Brazil&#8217;s central bank can use a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">contractionary monetary policy</span> to raise interest rates, which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively, Brazil&#8217;s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S. dollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.</p>
<p id="fs-idm49343248">Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market. However, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically allows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months or a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp9267952"><h1 data-type="title">Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs</h1>
<p id="fs-idm6757392">When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">monetary policy</span> to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even create additional movements of the exchange rate; for example, even the possibility of government intervention in exchange rate markets will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to those rumors. Let&#8217;s consider these issues in turn.</p>
<p id="fs-idp28942032">One concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country&#8217;s monetary policy is no longer focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into account. For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession&#8212;but it cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">central bank</span> can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession&#8212;but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate. With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3338192">Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">reserves</span>. Holding large reserves of other currencies has an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">opportunity cost</span>, and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit.</p>
<p id="fs-idp25257024">In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. But if the central bank runs out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.</p>
<p id="fs-idp4237856">Yet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy&#8212;when anticipated in the foreign exchange market&#8212;may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of <span data-type="term">international capital flows</span>&#8212;capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp5822800" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?</div>
<p id="fs-idp9965984">Some countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting inflows and outflows of international financial capital. This policy can be enacted either through targeted taxes or by regulations.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26362880">Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as <span data-type="term">Tobin taxes</span>, named after <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">James Tobin</span>, the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-term <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">portfolio investment</span> while exempting long-term foreign <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">direct investment</span>. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.</p>
<p id="fs-idp3638304">The goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope that doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.</p>
<p id="fs-idp25431808">But proposals to limit <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">international financial flows</span> have severe practical difficulties. Taxes are imposed by national governments, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried out within its territory, the exchange rate market might easily be operated by a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing. In an interconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments need to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult&#8212;in fact close to impossible&#8212;for a nation to allow only the flows of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a nation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.</p>
<p id="fs-idp41214528">Finally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help develop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idp49059888">A hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government first announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind&#8212;perhaps the government becomes unwilling to keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves&#8212;then the result of abandoning a hard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.</p>
<p id="fs-idp51971856">In the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-quarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach in favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time, lead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard peg exists. When the exchange rate does move, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have not planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went, it is better either to be clear that the exchange rate is always flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up being worst of all.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm35989136"><h1 data-type="title">A Merged Currency</h1>
<p id="fs-idp8469472">A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a <span data-type="term">merged currency</span>. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted the euro.</p>
<p id="fs-idp95776">However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that would have been made by a Portuguese central bank.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20915968">The lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. The range of exchange rates policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages, are summarized in <a href="#Table_29_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp34119152">Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If exchange rates are set solely by financial markets, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow&#8217;s news. If the government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p id="fs-idp21253360">There is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation&#8217;s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation&#8217;s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">balance of trade</span> will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy; conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals. On the other hand, a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm15750832" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?</div>
<p id="fs-idm103143408">The foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher price is good or bad depends on where you are standing: sellers benefit from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for U.S. imports (and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other countries, since their dollar goes further. But a stronger dollar is bad for U.S. exports (and people working in U.S. export industries); it is bad for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to higher U.S. interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry). In short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question than you may have thought. The economic answer is &#8220;it depends.&#8221;</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp90800" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm26035840">In a floating exchange rate policy, a country&#8217;s exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. In a soft peg exchange rate policy, a country&#8217;s exchange rate is usually determined in the foreign exchange market, but the government sometimes intervenes to strengthen or weaken the exchange rate. In a hard peg exchange rate policy, the government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in exchange markets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to make the currency stronger or weaker. Or it can directly purchase or sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates policies face tradeoffs. A hard peg exchange rate policy will reduce exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or controlling inflation. When a nation merges its currency with another nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.</p>
<p id="fs-idm38568640">A soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange rate markets try to anticipate when and how the government will intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to focus on inflation and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a risk that exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The spectrum of exchange rate policies includes: (a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or hard, and (c) a merged currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment, depending on which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based policy designed to keep the money supply stable and predictable.</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm54749792">
<p id="fs-idm35367824">A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest rates, would cause the currency to appreciate. The higher value of the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive. The higher value of the currency would similarly stimulate imports, since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX &#8211; IM) to fall, which causes aggregate demand to fall. The result would be a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on domestic investment expenditure. However, cheaper imports would stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though at a lower price level.</p>

<p id="fs-idp53368480">So you had trekked all the way to see Yellowstone National Park in the beautiful month of October 2013, only to find it&#8230; closed. Closed! Why?</p>
<p id="fs-idp106614144">For two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down. Many federal services, like the national parks, closed and 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the rest of the world: Congress and the President could not agree on a budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats argued about spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit. Each year's budget, which is over $3 trillion of spending, must be approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the budget is entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without congressional or presidential action once the programs are set up. Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt ceiling&#8212;how high the national debt of the U.S. government can be. The House of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the government unless they included provisions to stop or change the Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially known as Obamacare). As the days ticked by, the United States came very close to defaulting on its debt.</p><p id="fs-idp40331664">Why does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would happen if the United States actually defaulted on its debt? In this chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal policy. We will also look at the annual federal budget deficits and the national debt.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idp54508480">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul id="fs-idp106365712">
<li>Government Spending</li>
<li>Taxation</li>
<li>Federal Deficits and the National Debt</li>
<li>Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recessions, Unemployment, and Inflation</li>
<li>Automatic Stabilizers</li>
<li>Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy</li>
<li>The Question of a Balanced Budget</li>
</ul>
</div>















<p id="fs-idp141963888">All levels of government&#8212;federal, state, and local&#8212;have budgets that show how much revenue the government expects to receive in taxes and other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however, can shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and unexpected events shake up earlier tax and spending plans.</p>







<p id="fs-idp14485824">In this chapter, we revisit <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">fiscal policy</span>, which was first covered in <a href="/contents/0920969f-c95c-457d-b5ec-ee6360ffacab@2" class="target-chapter">Welcome to Economics!</a> Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy (the other is monetary policy). While <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">monetary policy</span> is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve, fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President.</p><p id="fs-idp62671936">The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand. All government spending and taxes affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government. We begin with an overview of U.S. government spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal policy from a short-run perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to address recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession and growth affect government budgets; and the merits of balanced budget proposals.</p>

  <p id="fs-idp2038352">Government spending covers a range of services provided by the federal, state, and local governments. When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a <span data-type="term">budget deficit</span>. Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a <span data-type="term">budget surplus</span>. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a <span data-type="term">balanced budget</span>. For example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 10% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2009, making it by far the largest budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing used to finance World War II.</p>







<p id="fs-idm26837856">This section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm94759184"><h1 data-type="title">Total U.S. Government Spending</h1>
<p id="fs-idp18158448">Federal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $3.9 trillion in 2014. Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.</p><p id="fs-idp53977504">The top line in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the level of federal spending since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since 1960. The other lines in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security, health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). Medicaid is also partially funded by state governments. Interest payments are the final main category of government spending shown in the figure.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">Federal Spending, 1960&#8211;2014</div><figcaption>Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22% of GDP, although it climbed above that level in 2009, but quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013. The share spent on national defense has generally declined, while the share spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp182692576">Each year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)&#8212;in essence borrowing from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.</p>
<p id="fs-idp73240464">The interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1&#8211;2% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.</p>
<p id="fs-idp9961760">We investigate the patterns of government borrowing and debt in more detail later in this chapter, but first we need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. <em data-effect="italics">The deficit is not the debt</em>. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what happens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time; it is the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.</p>
<p id="fs-idp82365008">These four categories&#8212;national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments&#8212;account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows. The remaining 27% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending: international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">Slices of Federal Spending, 2014</div><figcaption>About 73% of government spending goes to four major areas: national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm20461536"><h1 data-type="title">State and Local Government Spending</h1>
<p id="fs-idm122617008">Although federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government spending is also substantial&#8212;at about $3.1 trillion in 2014. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that state and local government spending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today. The single biggest item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways, libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of all of these.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_003"><div data-type="title" class="title">State and Local Spending, 1960&#8211;2013</div><figcaption>Spending by state and local government increased from about 10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14&#8211;16% by the mid-1970s.

</figure><p id="fs-idp27322656">U.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the U.S. system of government, these tasks are primarily the responsibilities of state and local governments. Indeed, in fiscal year 2014  state and local governments spent about $840 billion per year on education (including K&#8211;12 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal government, according to usgovernmentspending.com.   In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm8416880" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm42473920">Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In recent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not changed much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending and taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12&#8211;13% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades. The four main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments, which together account for about 70% of all federal spending. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.</p>

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idp71832496">
<p id="fs-idm8331984">Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the deficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be relatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the experience of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to about 1980.   It is also theoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks. It is possible that the decline in the nation&#8217;s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be proportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.</p>

<p id="fs-idp172490752">There are two main categories of taxes: those collected by the federal government and those collected by state and local governments. What percentage is collected and what that revenue is used for varies greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.</p>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp3040128"><h1 data-type="title">Federal Taxes</h1>
<p id="fs-idp27422608">Just as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except for 2009, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to recession.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">Federal Taxes, 1960&#8211;2014</div><figcaption>Federal tax revenues have been about 17&#8211;20% of GDP during most periods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source: <em data-effect="italics">Economic Report of the President, 2015.</em> Table B-21, https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/economic-report-of-the-President/2015)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp74066016" data-alt="The graph shows five lines that represent federal taxes (as a percentage of GDP). Total federal tax receipts was around 17% in 1960 and dropped to around 17.5% in 2014. Individual income taxes were consistently between 7% and 10%, but rose to 8% in 2014. Payroll taxes rose from under 5% in 1960 to around 6% in the 1980s. It has remained virtually consistent since then. Corporate income taxes has always remained below 5%. Excise taxes were highest in 1960 at around 2%; in 2009, it was less than 1%.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp131088"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> also shows the patterns of taxation for the main categories of taxes levied by the federal government: individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government, the first tax that comes to mind is the <span data-type="term">individual income tax</span> that is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.</p><p id="fs-idm95791072">The second largest source of federal revenue is the <span data-type="term">payroll tax</span> (captured in social insurance and retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80% of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.</p><p id="fs-idm67639408">The income tax is a <span data-type="term">progressive tax</span>, which means that the tax rates increase as a household&#8217;s income increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The <span data-type="term">marginal tax rates</span> (the tax that must be paid on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm25882288" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">How does the marginal rate work?</div>
<p id="fs-idm10421584">Suppose that a single taxpayer&#8217;s income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.</p>
</div>

<p id="fs-idp19092720">The key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at $118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.</p><p id="fs-idm55629520">In both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare.  However, as economists are quick to point out, the employer&#8217;s half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.</p>

<p id="fs-idp33373520">The Medicare payroll tax is also called a <span data-type="term">proportional tax</span>; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a <span data-type="term">regressive tax</span>, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.</p>

<p id="fs-idp51108320">The third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is the <span data-type="term">corporate income tax</span>. The common name for corporate income is &#8220;profits.&#8221; Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.</p>

<p id="fs-idm51130352">The federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an <span data-type="term">excise tax</span>&#8212;that is, a tax on a particular good&#8212;on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an <span data-type="term">estate and gift tax</span> on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation&#8212;either after death or during life in the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the estate and gift tax was repealed in 2010, but reinstated in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs collected on imported goods and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.</p></section>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm324832"><h1 data-type="title">State and Local Taxes</h1>
<p id="fs-idm74052144">At the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and charges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal government.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp30128416" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm156688320">The two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security and Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other federal taxes include the corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes out of their income than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare, where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the payroll tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share of income in taxes than those with lower incomes.</p>

<p id="fs-idm125221504">Having discussed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">revenue</span> (taxes) and expense (spending) side of the budget, we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus, which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year, which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year.</p>















<p id="fs-idm44867520"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the pattern of annual federal budget deficits and surpluses, back to 1930, as a share of GDP. When the line is above the horizontal axis, the budget is in surplus; when the line is below the horizontal axis, a budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to finance World War II. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, and most recently during the recession of 2008&#8211;2009.</p>

<p id="fs-idp32725808">Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits. The <span data-type="term">national debt</span> refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time; in contrast, the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the ratio of debt/GDP since 1940. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher&#8212;with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008&#8211;2009.</p>

Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s, the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/GDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008&#8211;2009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp55032960"><h1 data-type="title">The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits</h1>
<p id="fs-idp93077808">Why did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001? And why did the surpluses return to deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large after 2007? <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> suggests some answers. The graph combines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the federal budget since 1990.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990&#8211;2014 </div><figcaption>When government spending exceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in 2009.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp37104">Government spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was that defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in the later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late 1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on transfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people working.</p>

<p id="fs-idp48558272">This sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely unexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. But in the early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the recession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. A series of tax cuts was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled due to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were hurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous deficits.</p>

<p id="fs-idm78718656">Longer-term forecasts of the U.S. budget, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher deficits run during the recession of 2008&#8211;2009 have repercussions, and the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the &#8220;baby boom&#8221;&#8212;the exceptionally high birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the front edge of the baby boom generation began to reach age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of Americans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. The current level of the payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these programs, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for large budget deficits. A decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this long-term forecast.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm191407264" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?</div>
<p id="fs-idm22814288">In 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly&#8212;Social Security and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs. So, what are the options?</p>

<p id="fs-idm123663328">Long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009 are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080. If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to be increased dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.</p>

<p id="fs-idp32241472">Some proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.</p>

<p id="fs-idm129482928">The United States is not alone in this problem. Indeed, providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.</p>
</div>
<p id="fs-idp83668432">In the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we will explore proposals requiring a balanced budget&#8212;that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal each year. <a href="/contents/e97892bf-8113-45f9-892e-107d9adec52f@4" class="target-chapter">The Impacts of Government Borrowing</a> will also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing will affect national saving&#8212;and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idp50811760">For most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that debt slowly in peacetime. However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early 1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget deficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and 2009. A budget deficit or budget surplus is measured annually. Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget surpluses over time.</p>

<p id="fs-idm38732048">We need to emphasize that fiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to alter the economy. Fiscal policy does not include all spending (such as the increase in spending that accompanies a war).</p>







<p id="fs-idp10082784">Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through change in spending or taxes, shifts the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span> outward in the case of <span data-type="term">expansionary fiscal policy</span> and inward in the case of <span data-type="term">contractionary fiscal policy</span>. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand/aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy. The original equilibrium occurs at E<sub>0</sub>, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD<sub>0</sub> and aggregate supply curve SRAS<sub>0</sub>, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.</p><p id="fs-idm5711328">One year later, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate supply</span> has shifted to the right to SRAS<sub>1</sub> in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD<sub>1</sub>, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right, now to SRAS<sub>2</sub>, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD<sub>2</sub>. Now the equilibrium is E<sub>2</sub>, with an output level of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Healthy, Growing Economy </div><figcaption>In this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and aggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>. Each year, the economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. But if aggregate demand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can develop.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp84387856" data-alt="The graph shows three aggregate supply curves, three aggregate demand curves, and three potential GDP lines.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp23295488">Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Aggregate demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes. For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.</p>







<p id="fs-idp161786832"><a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2" class="target-chapter">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a> shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system to engage in countercyclical&#8212;or &#8220;against the business cycle&#8221;&#8212;actions. If recession threatens, the central bank uses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the supply of money, increase the quantity of loans, reduce interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses contractionary monetary policy to reduce the supply of money, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp80871104"><h1 data-type="title">Expansionary Fiscal Policy</h1>
<p id="fs-idm8833856">Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government spending or reductions in taxes. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investments by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through increased spending by the federal government on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investments, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.</p>
<p id="fs-idm58386816">Consider first the situation in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the recession in 2008&#8211;2009. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD<sub>0</sub>) and aggregate supply (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as indicated by the LRAS curve. At the equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD<sub>1</sub>, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level would rise back to the level P<sub>1</sub> associated with potential GDP.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_010"><div data-type="title" class="title">Expansionary Fiscal Policy </div><figcaption>The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of output (Y<sub>0</sub>) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E<sub>1</sub> at the level of potential GDP which is shown by the LRAS curve. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any inflationary increase in the price level from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> that results should be relatively small.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm63866672" data-alt="The graph shows two aggregate demand curves that each intersect with an aggregate supply curve.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idm92590288">Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal policy? After the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 (which started, actually, in very late 2007), U.S. government spending rose from 19.6% of GDP in 2007 to 24.6% in 2009, while tax revenues declined from 18.5% of GDP in 2007 to 14.8% in 2009. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that expansionary fiscal policy be implemented through spending increases. The Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. However, state and local governments, whose budgets were also hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending&#8212;a policy that offset federal expansionary policy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm102840624">The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as &#8220;liberal&#8221; or &#8220;conservative,&#8221; or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents. But the AD&#8211;AS model can be used both by advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending, and by advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending. Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help to inform decisions about whether taxes or spending should be changed, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is, in part, a political decision rather than a purely economic one.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm192942096"><h1 data-type="title">Contractionary Fiscal Policy</h1>
<p id="fs-idm174178352">Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD<sub>0</sub>) and aggregate supply (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) occurs at equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>, which is an output level above potential GDP. This is sometimes known as an &#8220;overheating economy&#8221; where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD<sub>1</sub>, and causing the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">A Contractionary Fiscal Policy </div><figcaption>The economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y<sub>0</sub>, which is above potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price level. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, leading to a new equilibrium output E<sub>1</sub>, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm77655120" data-alt="The graph shows two aggregate demand curves that each intersect with an aggregate supply curve.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idm60365536">Again, the AD&#8211;AS model does not dictate how this contractionary fiscal policy is to be carried out. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, aggregate demand needs to be reduced.</p>

  <p id="fs-idp29496288">Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases in government spending or through reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is in recession and producing below its potential GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of aggregate demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. Contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is producing above its potential GDP.</p>

<p id="fs-idm81313344">The millions of unemployed in 2008&#8211;2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries. Federal fiscal policies include <span data-type="term">discretionary fiscal policy</span>, when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The stimulus package of 2009 is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to <span data-type="term">automatic stabilizers</span>, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.</p>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp80084160"><h1 data-type="title">Counterbalancing Recession and Boom</h1>
<p id="fs-idp74656768">Consider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, <em data-effect="italics">both</em> changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.</p>

<p id="fs-idm14499984">The process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy&#8212;some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.</p><p id="fs-idp8129408">The very large budget deficit of 2009 was produced by a combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy. The Great Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe recession.</p>

<p id="fs-idp188061760">A glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as discussed in <a href="/contents/411630a6-6de7-44a1-a937-9c6f0f2341e8@2" class="target-chapter">Unemployment</a>). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991&#8211;2001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.</p></section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp48879968"><h1 data-type="title">The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus</h1>
<p id="fs-idp63192880">Each year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the <span data-type="term">standardized employment budget</span>&#8212;that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO&#8217;s standardized deficit.</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp31395472">Notice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like with the economy held constant&#8212;at its potential GDP level of output.</p>

<p id="fs-idm85067680">Automatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm157597744" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm109123440">Fiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts taxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any further legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget surplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year. Many economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns over time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy. We cover the critique of fiscal policy in the next module.</p>

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm80857072"><p id="fs-idp30366304">In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less income is earned, and so less in taxes is automatically collected. Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those who fall into certain categories, like &#8220;unemployed&#8221; or &#8220;low income,&#8221; are eligible for benefits. During a recession, more people fall into these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The combination of reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is needed for an economy in recession producing below potential GDP. With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so more in taxes is automatically collected. Fewer people meet the criteria for receiving government assistance to the unemployed or the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and welfare falls automatically. This combination of higher taxes and lower spending is just what is needed if an economy is producing above its potential GDP.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm150117648">In the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965, issue, <em data-effect="italics">Time</em> magazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">John Maynard Keynes</span>, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as &#8220;the prime influence on the world&#8217;s economies.&#8221; The article reported that policymakers have &#8220;used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [business] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.&#8221;</p><p id="fs-idp86167840">This happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.</p>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp66049168"><h1 data-type="title">Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp4154528">Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial capital markets</span>, it not only affects aggregate demand&#8212;it can also affect interest rates. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_C30_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in government budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.</p>

<p id="fs-idp26076672">A consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget surplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5&#8211;1.0% in the long-term interest rate.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Econ_C30_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates </div><figcaption>When a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it causes a shift in the demand for financial capital from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. As the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, the equilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to shift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate demand back to the left.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idm73864176" data-alt="The graph shows two demand curves that each intersect with a supply curve.

Demand curve (D sub 0) intersects with supply curve (S) at E sub 0 (point $800, 6%). Demand curve (D sub 1) intersects with supply curve (S) at E sub 1 (point $900, 7%)."></img>
</span>
</figure><p id="fs-idp31335104">A problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus reducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected. This is referred to as <span data-type="term">crowding out</span>, where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.</p>
<p id="fs-idp191519824">The broader lesson is that fiscal and monetary policy must be coordinated. If expansionary fiscal policy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely, monetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp113556512"><h1 data-type="title">Long and Variable Time Lags</h1>
<p id="fs-idp176635168">Monetary policy can be changed several times each year, but fiscal policy is much slower to be enacted. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two-month blip. The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the <span data-type="term">recognition lag</span>. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and then, if passed, eventually for the president&#8217;s signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time. The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the <span data-type="term">legislative lag</span>. Finally, once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs. The time to get the projects started is often called the <span data-type="term">implementation lag</span>.</p>


<p id="fs-idm52854096">Moreover, the exact level of fiscal policy to be implemented is never completely clear. Should the budget deficit be increased by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real world, the actual level of potential output is known only roughly, not precisely, and exactly how a spending cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew how deep in the hole the economy really was. During the financial crisis of 2008-09, the rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.</p><p id="fs-idm32595952">Thus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started&#8212;and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: &#8220;While the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have seen on many occasions, the economist&#8217;s lag is the politician&#8217;s nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm150064688"><h1 data-type="title">Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy</h1>
<p id="fs-idm5194080">A temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert back to its original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.</p>

<p id="fs-idm59496816">This fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. But if both policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.</p>

<p id="fs-idm29016912">When an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert back to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the internal structure of the economy evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the sectors of construction (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as discussed in <a href="/contents/b0a61a61-0f6b-44c4-b22d-54604b8b2c01@2">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and foreign competition. Many of the people thrown out of work from these sectors in the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy; instead, the economy will need to grow in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic change&#8212;the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement of workers to those industries&#8212;inevitably takes time.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp65176496" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">Why do jobs vanish?</div>
<p id="fs-idp11057632">People can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The Internet has created jobs but also caused the loss of jobs as well, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.</p>

<p id="fs-idp33644112">Fiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. But fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point, unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp95991104"><h1 data-type="title">Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy</h1>
<p id="fs-idp70823792">A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Politicians often have a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed down, it is time for the government to go on a spree, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. But countercyclical policy says that this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.</p>

<p id="fs-idm114519568">Politicians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm125441840"><h1 data-type="title">Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up</h1>
<p id="fs-idm202684624">Expansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.</p>
</section>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp51560576" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm91069600">Because fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand&#8212;it can also affect interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.</p>

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idm140879632"><p id="fs-idm140879504">Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy. Imagine that the data becomes fairly clear that an economy is in or near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out through open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly, since the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Open Market Committee meets six times a year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates, which can change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried out through acts of Congress that need to be signed into law by the president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after the laws are negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs or tax cuts to have an effect on the macroeconomy.</p></div>

<li>Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget deficit</li>
</ul></div>















<p id="fs-idm13100464">For many decades, going back to the 1930s, proposals have been put forward to require that the U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S. Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution would have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)</p>























<p id="fs-idp24158128">Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">balanced budget</span> with bemusement. After all, in the short term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement that the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.</p>























<p id="fs-idp110738656">Some supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their own budgets, the government should too. But this analogy between household and government behavior is severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to buy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save funds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government is not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities. The argument of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Keynesian macroeconomic policy</span> is that the government needs to lean against the wind, spending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.</p>























<p id="fs-idm68938576">There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">human capital</span> and physical <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">infrastructure</span> that will build the long-term productivity of a country. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of ongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War II up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as long as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will decline at the same time.</p>































<p id="fs-idp106238816">Nothing in this argument should be taken as a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons. <a href="/contents/e97892bf-8113-45f9-892e-107d9adec52f@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomics Impacts of Government Borrowing</a> will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases reduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget deficits can become too large.</p><div data-type="note" id="fs-idp42122800" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">No Yellowstone Park?</div>
<p id="fs-idp51340144">The federal budget shutdown of 2013 illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013, Republicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt should be. Due to the severity of the recession in 2008&#8211;2009, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a two-week shutdown of the federal government and got close to the deadline where the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and default was avoided. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.</p></div>

<p id="fs-idm60706688">Balanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are questionable. Most economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a problem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be necessary.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp42343248" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Financing Higher Education</div>
<p id="fs-idp66818912">On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher Education Act of 1965 into law. With a stroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help Americans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:</p>
<p id="fs-idm34688656">
</p><blockquote id="fs-idm32901824">Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to peace&#8212;for it is education that places reason over force.</blockquote>

<p id="fs-idm14429584">This Act, he said, "is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the United States&#8217; investment in &#8216;human capital&#8217;." Since the Act was first signed into law, it has been renewed several times.</p><p id="fs-idp113539824">The purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country&#8217;s human capital by creating educational opportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria used to judge eligibility are income, full-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to the 2011&#8211;2012 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), in the 2011&#8211;2012 school year, over 70% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 47% received grants; and another 55% received federal government student loans. The budget to support financial aid has increased not only because of increased enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for higher education. These increases are currently being questioned. The President and Congress are charged with balancing fiscal responsibility and important government-financed expenditures like investing in human capital.</p>

<div data-type="note" id="fs-idp44287664" class="note economics chapter-objectives"><div data-type="title" class="title">Introduction to the Impacts of Government Borrowing</div>
<p id="fs-idp26710560">In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul id="fs-idp47572656">
<li>How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance
</li>
<li>Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth
</li>
<li>How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving
</li>
<li>Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance
</li>
</ul>
</div>







<p id="fs-idp85972688">Governments have many competing demands for financial support. Any spending should be tempered by fiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending&#8217;s impact. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes especially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms, as well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.</p>







<p id="fs-idm13530864">The <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@4">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a> chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the national savings and investment identity, first introduced in <a href="/contents/c3e531f3-fce3-4ed5-8259-0a5c8fe61c6f@4">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a> chapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms&#8217; physical capital investment levels and trade balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds borrowed by the government to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment. Moreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains on a country&#8217;s banking and financial system.</p>

<p id="fs-idp138613488">When governments are borrowers in financial markets, there are three possible sources for the funds from a macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the additional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial investors. Let&#8217;s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.</p>















<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm61406336"><h1 data-type="title">The National Saving and Investment Identity</h1>
<p id="fs-idm114632528">The national saving and investment identity, first introduced in <a href="/contents/c3e531f3-fce3-4ed5-8259-0a5c8fe61c6f@4" class="target-chapter">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a> chapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial capital markets</span>. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">financial capital</span> supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.</p><p id="fs-idm65728032">The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings.</p><div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm141711120"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Total&#160;savings&#160;=&#160;Private&#160;savings&#160;(S)&#160;+&#160;Public&#160;savings&#160;(T&#160;&#8211;&#160;G)</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>Total&#160;savings&#160;=&#160;Private&#160;savings&#160;(S)&#160;+&#160;Public&#160;savings&#160;(T&#160;&#8211;&#160;G)</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div><p id="fs-idp17951648">These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit, as explained in <a href="/contents/c3e531f3-fce3-4ed5-8259-0a5c8fe61c6f@4" class="target-chapter">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a> chapter. So this inflow of foreign investment capital can be written as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, and can be written as the difference between government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let&#8217;s call this equation 1.</p><div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm71460064"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Quantity&#160;supplied&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Quantity&#160;demanded&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Private&#160;savings&#160;+&#160;Inflow&#160;of&#160;foreign&#160;savings</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Private&#160;investment&#160;+&#160;Government&#160;budget&#160;deficit</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S&#160;+&#160;(M&#160;&#8211;&#160;X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I&#160;+&#160;(G&#160;&#8211;T)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Quantity&#160;supplied&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Quantity&#160;demanded&#160;of&#160;financial&#160;capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Private&#160;savings&#160;+&#160;Inflow&#160;of&#160;foreign&#160;savings</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Private&#160;investment&#160;+&#160;Government&#160;budget&#160;deficit</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S&#160;+&#160;(M&#160;&#8211;&#160;X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I&#160;+&#160;(G&#160;&#8211;T)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div><p id="fs-idm151511920">Governments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T &#8211; G) is negative. This causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G &#8211; T) instead of adding to the nation&#8217;s savings. If this is the case, governments can be viewed as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. So, in algebraic terms, the national savings and investment identity can be rewritten like this:</p>

<p id="fs-idm42470640">The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal.

For example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses, although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits.

<p id="fs-idm208344448">As can be seen in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has consistently run budget deficits since 1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. (Recall that T is net taxes. When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the U.S. economy.</p>

<div data-type="item">Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget term appears with the demand for capital. You do not know in advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade surplus. But when you see that the quantity demanded of financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know that there must be an additional quantity of financial capital supplied by foreign investors, which means a trade deficit of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher budget deficit, and a higher trade deficit.

  <p id="fs-idm137234624">The underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all set in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-functioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms to invest in physical capital. But government spending can also encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development that creates new technology.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm60602240"><h1 data-type="title">Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment</h1>
<p id="fs-idm85836912">A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">physical capital</span>. When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">crowding out</span>.</p><p id="fs-idm54368896">To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. So investment in new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.</p>

</div><p id="fs-idp54503856">The patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980 are shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_003" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down at the same time. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000&#8212;a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP&#8212;a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-idm121119104">This argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment must also be taken into account. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5 billion&#8212;only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The "crowding out" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise, borrowing by the government may potentially create pressure on interest rates.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idm88451552">Assume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets?

</figure><p id="fs-idp11376992">A survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.</p>
<p id="fs-idm44443264">At this point, you may wonder about the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve</span>. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising? This useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">contractionary monetary policy</span>. In this situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.</p><p id="fs-idp68848576">On the other hand, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">expansionary monetary policy</span>. In this situation, higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding out of private investment.</p><p id="fs-idp35704912">However, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp123876944"><h1 data-type="title">Public Investment in Physical Capital</h1>
<p id="fs-idp28871440">Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills; telecommunications facilities; and weapons used by the military. In 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports. <a href="#Table_31_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the total outlay for 2014 for major public physical capital investment by the federal government in the United States.

</tbody></table><p id="fs-idm9811072">Public physical capital investment of this sort can increase the output and productivity of the economy. An economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. But it is hard to quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even go out of business.</p>
<p id="fs-idm71992624">In some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in the districts of key politicians. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians appreciate the extra business. On the other hand, governments sometimes do not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense; it must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment so that it is done in a cost-effective way can be difficult.</p>
<p id="fs-idm631376">If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment. Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a similar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical capital, which is more beneficial to the economy would be dependent on the project being considered.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp195308896"><h1 data-type="title">Public Investment in Human Capital</h1>
<p id="fs-idp111470736">In most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment in human capital through the education system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth. For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For the United States, tough questions have been raised about how much increases in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.</p><p id="fs-idp26614944">Among economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K&#8211;12) increased substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary education rose from $5,001 in 1998 to $10,608 in 2012. However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. Indeed, on international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are just inaccurate.)</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C31_011"><div data-type="title" class="title">Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998&#8211;2014) in the United States </div><figcaption>The graph shows that government spending on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it leveled off until 2008 when it increased dramatically.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp9295808">The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the resources spent.</p>
<p id="fs-idp7053536">Other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K&#8211;12 education system. Programs for early childhood education, like the federal <span data-type="term">Head Start program</span>, are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one student in 20.</p>
<p id="fs-idp73788224">Not all spending on educational <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">human capital</span>  needs to happen through the government: many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic increases in education spending.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm39531648"><h1 data-type="title">How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology</h1>
<p id="fs-idm10520336">Research and development (R&amp;D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&amp;D spending goes to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&amp;D spending may sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&amp;D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy than direct civilian R&amp;D spending.</p>
<p id="fs-idp61789024">Fiscal policy can encourage R&amp;D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on the R&amp;D that is carried out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&amp;D grants to universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&amp;D outlays totaled $135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&amp;D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.</p></section>

<p id="fs-idp5295888">Economic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology. Government borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and development. Possible methods for improving education and society&#8217;s investment in human capital include spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to provide greater incentives for success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to generate new technology include direct government spending on R&amp;D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct additional R&amp;D.</p>

There are a number of proposals to alter the incentives that schools face, but relatively little hard evidence on what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them: testing students regularly; rewarding teachers or schools that perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training; allowing students to choose between public schools; allowing teachers and parents to start new schools; giving student &#8220;vouchers&#8221; that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private schools.</p>

  <p id="fs-idp2522384">A change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people might reason: &#8220;Well, a higher budget deficit means that I&#8217;m just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I&#8217;ll start saving now.&#8221; If the government runs budget surpluses, people might reason: &#8220;With these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less attractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I won&#8217;t bother saving as much now.&#8221; </p>







<p id="fs-idm40538912">The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as <span data-type="term">Ricardian equivalence</span> because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772&#8211;1823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.</p>







<p id="fs-idm57682640">In practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses and the rate of private saving&#8212;which includes saving by both households and firms&#8212;since 1980. The connection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get very large in 2008 and 2009, on the other hand, there is some sign of a rise in saving. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study done in the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar result.</p>







<figure id="CNX_Econ_C31_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings </div><figcaption>The theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that any increase in government borrowing will be offset by additional private saving, while any decrease in government borrowing will be offset by reduced private saving.

In 2014, the gross private savings as around 20%, and the budget deficit/surplus was closer to &#8211;3%.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm31588800">So private saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short run and the long run.</p>







<p id="fs-idm85784496">If the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a budget deficit may be accompanied by a trade deficit. In some countries, this pattern of a <span data-type="term">twin deficits</span> has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm43579168" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm26670336">The theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in government borrowing or saving will be offset by changes in private saving. Thus, higher budget deficits will be offset by greater private saving, while larger budget surpluses will be offset by greater private borrowing. If the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing or saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance. However, empirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.</p>

<div data-type="problem" class="problem" id="fs-idp163673424">
<p id="fs-idp74945680">Imagine an economy in which Ricardian equivalence holds. This economy has a budget deficit of 50, a trade deficit of 20, private savings of 130, and investment of 100. If the budget deficit rises to 70, how are the other terms in the national saving and investment identity affected?</p>
</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-idp78708720">
<p id="fs-idp10097952">Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset exactly any changes in the government budget. So, if the deficit increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the trade deficit and the budget deficit will not change from their original levels. The original national saving and investment identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G &#8211; T) term is offset by a change in the S term, then the other terms do not change. So if (G &#8211; T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.</p>

  <p id="fs-idp26678432">Government budget balances can affect the trade balance. As <a href="/contents/b436d8b6-1cf4-4250-9626-873d8543c5a9@4" class="target-chapter">The Keynesian Perspective</a> chapter discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means foreigners&#8217; holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment.  One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that are sold by the U.S. government. So a budget deficit is often accompanied by a trade deficit.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm24922304"><h1 data-type="title">Twin Deficits?</h1>
<p id="fs-idm4558688">In the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985&#8212;a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985&#8212;a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s, the considerable increase in government borrowing was matched by an inflow of foreign investment capital, so the government budget deficit and the trade deficit moved together.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C31_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits </div><figcaption>In the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined at the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget deficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. But in 2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased. </figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp16673808" data-alt="The graph shows little relation between the rising (getting larger) and falling of the budget deficit and trade deficit since the 1980s.">

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idp181195648">Of course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and investment identity&#8212;investment and private savings&#8212;will often change as well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than twins.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp34877168"><h1 data-type="title">Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idm13945024">Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits. <a href="#CNX_Econ_C31_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows a situation using the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">exchange rate</span> for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), where the demand for U.S. dollars (D<sub>0</sub>) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S<sub>0</sub>) on the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion per day (which was roughly the quantity of dollar&#8211;euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s). Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for that budget deficit.</p><p id="fs-idp83726112">International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. At the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C31_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates </div><figcaption>Imagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and the funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to the right from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. The equilibrium exchange rate strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E<sub>0</sub> to 1.05 euros/dollar at E<sub>1</sub>.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-idp97164336" data-alt="This graph shows the demand and supply of foreign currency.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-idm167836032">A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.</p>
<p id="fs-idm143933920">You can also imagine this appreciation of the exchange rate as being driven by interest rates. As explained earlier in <a href="/contents/bb754731-feaa-4725-b083-3aa585f59ed2@2#CNX_Econ_C31_004">Budget Deficits and Interest Rates in Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth</a>, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although the connection should not be expected to be one-to-one.</p></section>























<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm95499472"><h1 data-type="title">From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis</h1>
<p id="fs-idm147291920">The economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession is laid out, step-by-step, in the <a href="/contents/53108975-2b0a-4253-a2f5-4bc26be84000@2" class="target-chapter">Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows</a> chapter. When international financial investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates, then Turkey&#8217;s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.</p><p id="fs-idm77012128">The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand, which causes a deep <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span>. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in 2002, this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995, Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997&#8211;1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. But beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.</p><p id="fs-idm27768880">One reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the borrowing will not be repaid. In the last 175 years, the government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans six times. Brazil&#8217;s government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm48144016" class="note economics clearup"><div data-type="title" class="title">What are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?</div>
<p id="fs-idm27824512">If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent report by the Brookings Institution, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high compared to the country&#8217;s GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm26138288">
<li>As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.</li>
<li>Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.</li>
<li>Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in the country&#8217;s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.</li>
</ul>
<p id="fs-idp87475776">The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.</p>
<p id="fs-idm43506848">What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12423616"><h1 data-type="title">Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances</h1>
<p id="fs-idm113881792">If a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.</p>
<p id="fs-idm114840976">However, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country&#8217;s exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.</p>
<p id="fs-idm69247472">Reducing a nation&#8217;s budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-idm54995296" class="note economics bringhome"><div data-type="title" class="title">Financing Higher Education</div>
<p id="fs-idm158867232">Over the period between 1982 and 2012, the increases in the cost of a college education had far outpaced that of the income of the typical American family. According to the research done by the President Obama&#8217;s staff, the cost of education at a four-year public college increased by 257% compared to an increase in family incomes of only 16% over the prior 30 years. The ongoing debate over a balanced budget and proposed cutbacks accentuated the need to increase investment in human capital to grow the economy versus deepening the already significant debt levels of the U.S. government. In the summer of 2013, President Obama presented a plan to make college more affordable that included increasing Pell Grant awards and the number of recipients, caps on interest rates for student loans, and providing education tax credits. In addition, the plan includes an accountability method for institutions of higher education that focuses on completion rates and creates a College Scorecard. Whether or not all these initiatives come to fruition remains to be seen, but they are indicative of creative approaches that government can take to meet its obligation from both a public and fiscal policy perspective.</p>

<p id="fs-idm113615168">The government need not balance its budget every year. However, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits over time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand that causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a way that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio investment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a macroeconomy.</p>

<p id="fs-idp98714816">In the late 1990s, the U.S. government moved from a budget deficit to a budget surplus and the trade deficit in the U.S. economy grew substantially.

If investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private savings must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then investment must go up. In fact, both effects happened; that is, in the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment rose.</p>

<p id="Ch32Mod00P01">Chad Harding, a young man from Cape Town, South Africa, completed school having done well on his exams. He had high hopes for the future. Like many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. &#8220;I was just stuck at home waiting, waiting for something to come up,&#8221; he said in a BBC interview in 2012. In South Africa 54.6% of young females and 47.2% of males are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world&#8217;s youth aged 15 to 24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.</p><p id="Ch32Mod00P02">According to the <em data-effect="italics">Wall Street Journal,</em> in India, 60% of the labor force is self-employed, largely because of labor market regulation. A recent World Development Report by The World Bank says that India&#8217;s unemployed youth accounted for 9.9% of the youth work force in 2010. In Spain (a far richer country) in the same year, the female/male youth unemployment rate was 39.8% and 43.2% respectively.</p><p id="Ch32Mod00P03">Youth unemployment is a significant issue in many parts of the world. However, despite the apparent similarities in rates between South Africa, Spain, and India, macroeconomic policy solutions to decrease youth unemployment in these three countries are different. This chapter will look at macroeconomic policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and exchange rates. Then we will look again at the three cases of South Africa, Spain, and India.</p></div>

<li>The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World</li>

<li>Balance of Trade Concerns</li>

<p id="Ch32Mod00P06">There are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance of economies across the world. What explains these differences? Are countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic policy? Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework developed in this text to understand the performance of these countries? Let&#8217;s take each of these questions in turn.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod00P07"><em data-effect="italics">Explaining differences</em>: Recall from <a href="/contents/411630a6-6de7-44a1-a937-9c6f0f2341e8@2" class="target-chapter">Unemployment</a> that we explained the difference in composition and performance of economies by appealing to an aggregate production function. We argued that the diversity of average incomes across the world was explained by differences in productivity, which in turn were affected by inputs such as capital deepening, human capital, and &#8220;technology.&#8221; Every economy has its own distinctive economic characteristics, institutions, history, and political realities, which imply that access to these &#8220;ingredients&#8221; will vary by country and so will economic performance.</p><p id="Ch32Mod00P08">For example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to increase agricultural productivity in the early 1950s. Some of this investment came from its historical relationship with the United States. As a result of these and many other institutions, its economy has managed to converge to the levels of income in leading economies like Japan and the United States.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod00P09"><em data-effect="italics">Similar goals and frameworks</em>: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income have&#8212;for better or worse&#8212;been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens. Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal macroeconomic goals as discussed in <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>. No country would argue against them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin by comparing standards of living. In keeping with these goals, we also look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of trade policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a diverse set of experiences; therefore although our goals may be similar, each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its circumstances.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="Ch32Mod00Link01" class="note economics linkup" data-label="">

<p id="Ch32Mod01P01">The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">GDP per capita</span>, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As explained in <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>, we must consider using <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">purchasing power parity</span> or &#8220;international dollars&#8221; to convert average incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as formally defined in <a href="/contents/53108975-2b0a-4253-a2f5-4bc26be84000@2" class="target-chapter">Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows</a>, takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries.</p><p id="Ch32Mod01P02"><a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China's case, for example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan being third. But, when we take China's GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion, then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of the United States, at $52,800.  Measurement issues aside, it&#8217;s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall standards of living for individuals. As we have learned from <a href="/contents/093b7e3a-77c6-4f91-a6c8-2eb7d1a9cc1f@2" class="target-chapter">Economic Growth</a>, this can be achieved at the national level by designing policies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.</p><p id="Ch32Mod01P03">GDP per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, middle-, or low-income groups. Low-income countries are those with $1,025 per capita GDP per year; middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between $1,025 and $12,475; while high-income countries have over $12,475 per year per capita income. As seen in <a href="#Ch32Mod01Tab01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, high-income countries earn 68% of world income, but represent just 12% of the global population.

In turn, people in the high-income nations of the world, such as those who live in the European Union nations or North America, have a per capita GDP three to four times that of the people of Latin America.

</tbody></table><p id="Ch32Mod01P05">Such comparisons between regions are admittedly rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the quality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human rights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide differences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita income, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">standards of living</span>. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="Ch32Mod01Link01" class="note economics linkup" data-label="">
<p id="Ch32Mod01P06">Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community.

</div><p id="Ch32Mod01P07">The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">neoclassical determinants of growth</span>, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.</p><p id="Ch32Mod01P08"><strong>Geographic and Demographic Differences</strong></p>







<p id="Ch32Mod01P09">Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large rivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for commerce, health, and the environment.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod01P10">Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income nations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the population. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about 2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic changes will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.</p><p id="Ch32Mod01P11"><strong>Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions</strong></p>







<p id="Ch32Mod01P12">Countries have differences in industry structure. In the high-income economies of the world, only about 2% of GDP comes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in degree of urbanization.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod01P13">Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are extremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to international trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are differences in political, religious, and social institutions as well.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod01P14">No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an unsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how nations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod01_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod01P15">Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well as stable trade balances. Countries are analyzed based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global income. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per capital income of $1,025&#8211;$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-income countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have 12% of the world&#8217;s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within those regions tend to differ from each other.</p></section>

<p id="Ch32Mod01P20">A region can have some of high-income countries and some of the low-income countries. Aggregating per capita real GDP will vary widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a region has little meaning. For example, if you were to compare per capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti, and Honduras, it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for North America as a whole. Thus, regional comparisons are broad-based and may not adequately capture an individual country&#8217;s economic attributes.</p>

<p id="Ch32Mod02P01">Jobs are created in economies that grow. Where does economic growth come from? According to most economists who believe in the <span data-type="term">growth consensus</span>, economic growth (as discussed in <a href="/contents/093b7e3a-77c6-4f91-a6c8-2eb7d1a9cc1f@2" class="target-chapter">Economic Growth</a>) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth, however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as illustrated by the differences in per capita GDP presented earlier in <a href="/contents/42a4906b-0345-4836-ae2a-ea00539345a3@4#Ch32Mod01Tab02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod02_01"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries</h1><p id="Ch32Mod02P02">For the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to <a href="/contents/dce57e88-69b4-4de1-8122-f45ecdd3bda3@4">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</a>). The main public policies targeted at achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on investment, including investment in human capital, in technology, and in physical plant and equipment. These countries also recognize that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented economic climate. For this reason, they use monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and international competition.</p><p id="Ch32Mod02P03">However, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many high-income countries found themselves more focused on the short term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all experienced a combination of financial crisis and deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession&#8212;like high unemployment rates&#8212;seemed likely to linger for several years. Most of these governments took aggressive, and in some cases controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running very large budget deficits as part of expansionary fiscal policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower government spending and higher taxes.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P04">Similarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see <a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), then newly-elected Prime Minister of Japan, unveiled a plan to get his country out of its two-decade-long slump in economic growth. It included both fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan was quite successful in the short run. However, according to the <em data-effect="italics">Economist</em>, with public debt &#8220;expected to approach 240% of GDP,&#8221; (as of 2012 it was 226% of GDP) printing money and public-works spending were only short-term solutions.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_007"><div data-type="title" class="title">Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe</div><figcaption>Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister used fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate his country&#8217;s economy, which has worked in only the short run.

</span>

</figure><p id="Ch32Mod02P05">As other chapters discuss, macroeconomics needs to have both a short-run and a long-run focus. The challenge for many of the developed countries in the next few years will be to exit from the short-term policies that were used to correct the 2008&#8211;2009 recession. Since the return to growth has been sluggish, it has been politically challenging for these governments to refocus their efforts on new technology, education, and physical capital investment.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod02_02"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P06">The world&#8217;s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the <span data-type="term">East Asian Tigers</span>: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, although these are often treated under international law as part of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth of the Tigers has been phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other countries began to show signs of convergence. China began growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year. India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first decade of the 2000s.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P07">The underlying causes of these rapid growth rates are known:</p>
<ul id="Ch32Mod02L01">
<li>China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among the highest savers in the world, often saving one-third or more of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would be a more typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These higher savings were harnessed for domestic investment to build physical capital.</li>
<li>These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in human capital, first building up primary-level education and then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on encouraging math and science education, which is useful in engineering and business.</li>
<li>Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable technology, by sending students and government commissions abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations elsewhere. They also created policies to support innovative companies that wished to build production facilities to take advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.</li>
<li>China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom for market forces, both within their own domestic economies and also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P08">This combination of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">technology</span>, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">human capital</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">physical capital</span>, combined with the incentives of a market-oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth. Challenges faced by these middle-income countries are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time. In many of them, the banking and financial sector is heavily regulated. Governments have also sometimes selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or government subsidies. These economies have found that an increased dose of market-oriented incentives for firms and workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster growth. To learn more about measuring economic growth, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="Ch32Mod01Eco01" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">What is the rule of 72?</div>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P09">It is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the growth rates of the East Asian Tigers. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6% per year, then you can apply the formula for compound growth rates&#8212;that is (1 + 0.06)<sup>30</sup>&#8212;meaning a nation&#8217;s level of per capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years. Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is an approximation to figure out doubling time. The rule number, 72, is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years it will take for income to double. So if we have a 6% growth rate, it will take 72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at 6% will double its GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth rates of about 2% per year, would double its income in 36 years.</p></div>

<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod02_03"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P10">Many economically-challenged or low-income countries are geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other pockets of low income are found in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P11">There are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might alleviate the extreme poverty and low standard of living. However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal stability, along with market-oriented institutions, needed to provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to attract foreign investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low income economies are vastly different from those of the high income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to combat poverty and raise overall income levels through 2030. One of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political instability that seems to be a common feature of low-income countries.</p><p id="Ch32Mod02P12"><a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The World Bank in 2013. These countries share some common traits, the most significant of which is the recent failures of their governments to provide a legal framework for economic growth. Ethiopia and Eritrea recently ended a long-standing war in 2000. Civil and ethnic wars have plagued countries such as Burundi and Liberia. Command economies, corruption, as well as political factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in these low-income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as &#8220;Congo&#8221;) is a resource-wealthy country that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of living due to the political environment.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_004"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Ten Lowest Income Countries</div><figcaption>This bar chart that shows ten low-income countries, which include, from lowest income to highest: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Liberia, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Niger, Madagascar, and Afghanistan.

</span>

</figure><p id="Ch32Mod02P13">Low-income countries are at a disadvantage because any incomes received are spent immediately on necessities such as food. People in these countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than $100 per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT economists, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Abhijit Bannerjee</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Esther Duflo</span>, has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they cannot muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty.</p><p id="Ch32Mod02P14">For example, the average citizen of Burundi, the lowest-income country, subsists on $150 per year (adjusted to 2005 dollars). According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook, as of 2013, 90% of Burundi&#8217;s population is agrarian, with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends school and, as shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, many are not in schools comparable to what is found in developed countries. The CIA Factbook also estimates that 15% of Burundi&#8217;s population suffers from HIV/AIDS. Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make significant headway toward growth, as verified by the electrification of only 2% of households and 42% of its national income coming from foreign aid.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">Lack of Funds for Investing in Human Capital</div><figcaption>In low-income countries, all income is often spent on necessities for living and cannot be accumulated or invested in physical or human capital.

</div><p id="Ch32Mod02P16">Other low-income countries share similar stories. These countries have found it difficult to generate investments for themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the money for more than the basic needs. Foreign aid and external investment comprise significant portions of the income in these economies, but are not sufficient to allow for the capital accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital. But is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth? It can be a controversial issue, as the next Clear it Up feature points out.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="Ch32mod02CLEAR01" class="note economics clearup" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Does foreign aid to low-income countries work?</div>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P17">According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in foreign aid flows from the high-income countries of the world to the low-income ones. Relative to the size of their populations or economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or recipients. For low-income countries, aid averages about 1.3 percent of their GDP. But even this relatively small amount has been highly controversial.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P18">Supporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary human suffering in the low-and middle-income countries of the world. They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to set up health clinics and schools. They want to help with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water, plumbing, electricity, and roads. Supporters of this aid include formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom&#8217;s Department for International Development (DFID) or independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International that also receive donor government funds. For example, because of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010, DFID channeled significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train rural health care workers and also for vaccines. These monies helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P19">Opponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign aid has often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example, according to an article in the <em data-effect="italics">Attach&#233; Journal of International Affairs</em>, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided $100 million to Tanzania to grow wheat. The project did produce wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had lived on the land were driven off 100,000 acres of land to make way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and lost livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be significant.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P20">William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University and author of <em data-effect="italics">The White Man&#8217;s Burden</em>, argues that aid is often given for political reasons and ends up doing more harm than good. If the government of a country creates a reasonably stable and market-oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable activities. For example, according to <em data-effect="italics">The New York Times</em>, Facebook is partnering with multiple organizations in a project called Internet.org to provide access in remote and low-income areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called Project Loon. Facebook&#8217;s first forays into providing Internet access via mobile phones began in stable, market-oriented countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P21">Policymakers are now wiser about the limitations of foreign aid than they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific cases, especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to play in reducing the extreme levels of deprivation experienced by hundreds of millions of people around the world.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod02_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod02P23">The fundamentals of growth are the same in every country: improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are high-income tend to focus on developing and using new technology. Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They have charted unconventional paths by relying more on state-led support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income, economically-challenged countries have many health and human development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads. There are some bright spots when it comes to financial development and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries can become technology leaders in their own right, but it is too early to claim victory. These countries must do more to connect to the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work best for them.</p>

<p id="Ch32Mod03P01">The causes of unemployment in high-income countries of the world can be categorized in two ways: either cyclical unemployment caused by the economy being in a recession, or the natural rate of unemployment caused by factors in labor markets, such as government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.
</p><section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod03_01"><h1 data-type="title">Unemployment from a Recession</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod03P02">For <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">unemployment</span> caused by a recession, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Keynesian economic model</span> points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run an <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">expansionary monetary policy</span> to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">aggregate demand</span>. In a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">recession</span>, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in interest rates.</p><p id="Ch32Mod03P03">With regard to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">fiscal policy</span>, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">automatic stabilizers</span> discussed in <a href="/contents/90ca9b65-c875-4b82-91ea-41661e78ff8f@4" class="target-chapter">Government Budget and Fiscal Policy</a> should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is less agreement over whether, in addition to automatic stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">discretionary fiscal policy</span> of additional tax cuts or spending increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the case for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger, but for a smaller recession, given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy, discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution.</p><p id="Ch32Mod03P04">However, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a recession is officially over, and positive growth has returned, it can take some months&#8212;or even a couple of years&#8212;before private-sector firms believe the economic climate is healthy enough that they can expand their workforce.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod03_02"><h1 data-type="title">The Natural Rate of Unemployment</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod03P05">Unemployment rates in the nations of Europe have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2006, before the start of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Great Recession</span>, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6%, compared with 9% in France, 10.4% in Germany, and 7.1% in Sweden. The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs.</p><p id="Ch32Mod03P06">Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. Government can play a useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, passing rules about where and when businesses can operate, assuring that the workplace is safe, and so on. But these well-intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.</p><p id="Ch32Mod03P07">For example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that businesses try to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France. According to <em data-effect="italics">Business Week</em>, &#8220;France has 2.4 times as many companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the French labor code, once a company has at least 50 employees inside France, management must create three worker councils, introduce profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the councils if the company decides to fire workers for economic reasons.&#8221; This labor law essentially limits employment (or raises the natural rate of unemployment).</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod03_03"><h1 data-type="title">Undeveloped Labor Markets</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod03P08">Low-income and middle-income countries face employment issues that go beyond unemployment as it is understood in the high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these economies provide many of their own needs by farming, fishing, or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes being paid with food or shelter, sometimes with money. They are not &#8220;unemployed&#8221; in the sense that the term is used in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod03P09">The starting point of economic activity, as discussed in <a href="/contents/0920969f-c95c-457d-b5ec-ee6360ffacab@2" class="target-chapter">Welcome to Economics!</a>, is the division of labor, in which workers specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor with others. Workers who are not connected to a labor market are often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are not &#8220;officially&#8221; employed, they are often not eligible for social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age payments&#8212;if such payments are even available in their country. Helping these workers to become more connected to the labor market and the economy is an important policy goal. Indeed, recent research by development economists suggests that one of the key factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the worst kind of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a somewhat regular wage-paying job.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod03_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod03P10">Cyclical unemployment can be addressed by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The natural rate of unemployment can be harder to deal with, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved in laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is understood differently in high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries. People in these countries are not &#8220;unemployed&#8221; in the sense that term is used in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part of a barter economy.</p></section>

<p id="Ch32Mod04P01">Policymakers of the high-income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">inflation</span>. First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run, monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term. Second, there is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact, allowing inflation to become lasting and persistent poses undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high, businesses and individuals need to spend time and effort worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather than seeking out better ways to serve customers. In short, the high-income economies appear to have both a political consensus to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so.</p><p id="Ch32Mod04P02">In a number of middle- and low-income economies around the world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In the early 2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year for several years. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to 2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had inflation rates of 20% to 30% per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had hyperinflation, with inflation rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to a rate of several million percent in 2008.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod04P03">In these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally arises from huge budget deficits, which are financed by the government printing its domestic currency. This is a case of &#8220;too much money chasing too few goods.&#8221; In the case of Zimbabwe, the government covered its widening deficits by printing ever higher currency notes, including a $100 trillion bill. By late 2008, the money was nearly worthless, which led Zimbabwe to adopt the U.S. dollar, immediately halting their hyperinflation. In some countries, the central bank makes loans to politically favored firms, essentially printing money to do so, and this too leads to higher inflation.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod04P04">A number of countries have managed to sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of time with levels of inflation that would sound high by recent U.S. standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such economies, most contracts, wage levels, and interest rates are indexed to inflation. Indexing wage contracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power. When wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent. It is clearly possible&#8212;and perhaps sometimes necessary&#8212;for a <span data-type="term">converging economy</span> (the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.

<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod04_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title"> Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod04P05">Most high-income economies have learned that their central banks can control inflation in the medium and the long term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term benefits but potentially substantial long-term costs if it distracts businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However, smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation because their smaller economies can be unsettled by international movements of capital and goods.</p>

<p id="Ch32Mod05P01">In the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, openness to global flows of goods, services, and financial capital was often viewed in a negative light by low- and middle-income countries. These countries feared that foreign trade would mean both economic losses as their economy was &#8220;exploited&#8221; by high-income trading partners and a loss of domestic political control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.</p>







<p id="Ch32Mod05P02">These negative feelings about international trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and India, all took advantage of opportunities to sell in global markets. The economies of Europe thrive with high levels of trade. In the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</span>, the United States, Canada, and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers. Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy. Indeed, many smaller economies of the world have learned an even tougher lesson: if they do not participate actively in world trade, they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging economies. There are no examples in world history of small economies that remained apart from the global economy but still attained a high standard of living.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P03">Although almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate in global trade, the possible negative consequences have remained highly controversial. It is useful to divide up these possible negative consequences into issues involving trade of goods and services and issues involving flows of international capital. These issues are related, but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and services relative to GDP, but if exports and imports are balanced, the net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be zero. Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative to GDP, but find that it has a substantial current account trade imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over international trade of goods and services and international flows of financial capital separately.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod05_01"><h1 data-type="title">Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P04">There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. These arguments are discussed at some length in <a href="/contents/c3e531f3-fce3-4ed5-8259-0a5c8fe61c6f@4" class="target-chapter">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P05">Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">infant industry argument</span>; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established. (<a href="/contents/1e325274-8f38-40cc-b775-45a1656cbc62@2" class="target-chapter">Globalization and Protectionism</a> explains this concept in more detail.) Such policies have been used with some success at certain points in time, but in the world as a whole, support for key industries is far more often directed at long-established industries with substantial political power that are suffering losses and laying off workers, rather than potentially vibrant new industries that have yet to be established. If government is going to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a way that is temporary and that orients them toward a future of market competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and trade protection.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod05_02"><h1 data-type="title">Concerns over International Flows of Capital</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P06">Recall from <a href="/contents/03158e85-cb2c-4a74-932e-dcc1e77fd8bb@4" class="target-chapter">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> that a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">trade deficit</span> exists when a nation&#8217;s imports exceed its exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries must provide loans or investments, which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually (that the deficit will become a surplus). A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">trade surplus</span>, you may remember, exists when a nation&#8217;s exports exceed its imports. So, in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade surplus, a nation&#8217;s exports must rise and its imports must fall. Sometimes this happens when the currency decreases in value. For example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated, imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the foreign countries who provided the loans or investments.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P07">The expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been that high-income economies will run trade surpluses, which means they will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or export more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies will run trade deficits, which means that they will experience a net inflow of foreign capital.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P08">This pattern of international investing can benefit all sides. Investors in the high-income countries benefit because they can receive high returns on their investments, and also because they can diversify their investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own domestic economy. The low-income economies that receive an inflow of capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth, and they can use the inflow of international financial capital to help spur their physical capital investment. In addition, inflows of financial capital often come with management abilities, technological expertise, and training.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P09">However, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two &#8220;dark clouds.&#8221; The first cloud is the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See <a href="/contents/c3e531f3-fce3-4ed5-8259-0a5c8fe61c6f@4" class="target-chapter">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>.) Instead of offering net financial investment abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world. These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Sebastian Edwards</span> writing for the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily. In the gradual scenario, U.S. exports could grow more rapidly than imports over a period of years, aided by a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. An unintended consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a decline in the size of the U.S. current account deficit from 6% pre-recession to 3% most recently.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P10">The other option is that the U.S. trade deficit could be reduced in a rush. Here is one scenario: if foreign investors became less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could weaken. As speculators see this process happening, they might rush to unload their dollar assets, which would drive the dollar down still further.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P11">A lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting the short-term aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a burst of inflation and, if the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Federal Reserve</span> were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to recession. People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy, with its great size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets. While it is tough to rock, it is not impossible for the $17 trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P12">The second &#8220;dark cloud&#8221; is how the smaller economies of the world should deal with the possibility of sudden inflows and outflows of foreign financial capital. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially destructive forces of international capital movements occurred in the economies of the East Asian Tigers in 1997&#8211;1998. Thanks to their excellent growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had attracted considerable interest from foreign investors. In the mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these countries surged even further. Much of this money was funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S. dollars and loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of foreign capital meant that investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so that current account deficits in these countries jumped into the range of 5&#8211;10% of GDP.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P13">The surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian countries did not do an especially good job of screening out safe and unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans&#8212;as high as 10% to 15% of all loans in some of these countries&#8212;started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started pulling their money out. As the foreign money left, the exchange rates of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their domestic loans were repaid, they could never pay back the U.S. dollars that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of credit and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing on a deep recession.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P14">If the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years, economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which led to protests throughout the country (<a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">Protests in Greece</div><figcaption>The economic conditions in Greece have deteriorated from the Great Recession such that the government had to enact austerity measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its population.

</figure><p id="Ch32Mod05P15">Many nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will be injured if foreign financial capital takes flight, including having their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping up their regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent lending. The most controversial steps in this area involve whether countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of foreign capital. If a country could discourage some of the inflow of speculative short-term capital, and instead only encourage investment capital that was committed for the medium term and the long term, then it could be at least somewhat less susceptible to swings in the sentiments of global investors.</p>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P16">If economies participate in the global trade of goods and services, they will also need to participate in international flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer great benefits to an economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern. During the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Asian Financial Crisis</span> in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.</p></section>







<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod05_03"><h1 data-type="title">Market-Oriented Economic Reforms</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P17">The standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As <a href="#CNX_Econ_C32_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates, modern technology allows for the investment in education and human capital development in ways that would have not been possible just a few short years ago.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_C32_006"><div data-type="title" class="title">Solar-powered Technology</div><figcaption>Modern technologies, such as solar-power and Wi-Fi, enable education to be delivered to students even in remote parts of a country without electricity.

</figure><p id="Ch32Mod05P18">Other than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of macroeconomic policy&#8212;that is, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade&#8212;all involve situations in which, for some reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand. In the case of cyclical unemployment, for example, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output below potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment, government regulations create a situation where otherwise-willing employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation is a situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at least for a time, so that too much buying power is chasing too few goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow or outflow of foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with domestic investment. Each of these situations can create a range of easier or harder policy choices.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="Ch32Mod05BringHome01" class="note economics bringhome" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Youth Unemployment: Three Cases</div>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P19">Spain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2011, but the reasons for this unemployment are different. Spain&#8217;s youth unemployment surged due to the Great Recession of 2008&#8211;2009 and heavy indebtedness on the part of its citizens and its government. Spain&#8217;s current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing heavily. To cure cyclical unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian model suggests increases in government spending&#8212;fiscal expansion or monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can borrow at only high interest rates, which will be a real problem in terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU) has dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro and cannot devalue its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. So what can be done? The <em data-effect="italics">Economist</em>, summarizing some of the ideas of economists and policymakers, suggests that Spain&#8217;s only realistic (although painful) option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to reduce government spending. As a result, the government would be able to lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower tax environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also encourage greater foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic savings.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P20">South Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is an interesting case because its youth unemployment is mostly due to the fact that its young are not ready to work. This is commonly referred to as an employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as reported in the <em data-effect="italics">Economist</em>, the young are academically smart but lack practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase investment in human capital, the results have not yet borne fruit. Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while they were &#8220;trained-up&#8221; or apprenticed in South African firms. The government has room to increase fiscal expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for foreign investment from technology leaders, which would encourage economic growth.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P21">India has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages. However, bear in mind that since this is a populous country, it turns out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik Basu, writing for the BBC, &#8220;there are 45 national laws governing the hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that amount at the state level&#8221;. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire workers. To stay nimble and responsive to markets, Indian companies respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can do much to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially, the government has to remove itself from firms&#8217; hiring and firing decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers. Indian workers, like those in South Africa, do not have workforce skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education, vocational training, and workforce readiness programs.</p><p id="Ch32Mod05P22">Finally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital flows. To solve this deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic savers from investing abroad. This is a step in the right direction that may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed Indians can get access to capital to realize their business ideas. If more Indians can get access to capital to start businesses, employment might increase.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="Ch32Mod05_summ" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="Ch32Mod05P23">There are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences of free trade. Perhaps the single strongest response to these concerns is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade and thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade imbalances. One is what will happen with the large U.S. trade deficits, and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is whether smaller countries around the world should take some steps to limit flows of international capital, in the hope that they will not be quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial capital flowing in and out of their economies.</p>

<p id="Ch32Mod05P25">Given the high level of activity in international financial markets, it is typically believed that financial flows across borders are the real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had an enormous trade deficit in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast inflows of foreign capital. Smaller countries that have attracted such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows suddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency could collapse their banking system and bring on a deep recession.</p>

<p id="fs-idp55859248">(This appendix should be consulted after first reading <a href="/contents/0920969f-c95c-457d-b5ec-ee6360ffacab@2" class="target-chapter">Welcome to Eonomics!</a>) Economics is not math. There is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.</p><p id="fs-idp141516464">There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:</p>















   <ul id="fs-idp9396560">
      <li>What a function is</li>
      <li>How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)</li>
      <li>How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)</li>
      <li>How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)</li>
      <li>How to read and manipulate a graph</li>
    </ul>















<p id="fs-idm90918496">In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.</p>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp12777936"><h1 data-type="title">Algebraic Models</h1>
<p id="fs-idp163417056">Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">function</span> describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn + Margaret.</p>
<p id="fs-idp169955968">Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained (&#8220;the effect&#8221;). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (&#8220;the causes&#8221;). For example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp98482096"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>GPA&#160;=&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;combined_SAT&#160;+&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;class_attendance&#160;+&#160;0.50&#160;&#215;&#160;hours_spent_studying</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>GPA&#160;=&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;combined_SAT&#160;+&#160;0.25&#160;&#215;&#160;class_attendance&#160;+&#160;0.50&#160;&#215;&#160;hours_spent_studying</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idp86730304">This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.</p>
<p id="fs-idp75133536">Of course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are economics books and music.</p>
<p id="fs-idp151044960">Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp100824704"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>y&#160;=&#160;b&#160;+&#160;mx</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>y&#160;=&#160;b&#160;+&#160;mx</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>

<p id="fs-idp93748496"><strong data-effect="bold">Expressing Equations Graphically</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm77907312">Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.</p>
<p id="fs-idp253633648">To a mathematician or an economist, a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">variable</span> is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this equation works, consider a numerical example:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp99253632"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>y&#160;=&#160;9&#160;+&#160;3x</mtext></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtext>y&#160;=&#160;9&#160;+&#160;3x</mtext></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idp24453776">In this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3. <a href="#Table_A_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the values of x and y for this given equation. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows this equation, and these values, in a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of y results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.</p>

The y-intercept&#8212;that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis&#8212;is 9.

<p id="fs-idp51829088">This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">slope</span> is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope&#8212;that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line&#8212;will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.</p>
<p id="fs-idp41539504"><strong data-effect="bold">Interpreting the Slope</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp111178496">The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">positive slope</span> means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="fs-idp150995232">A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">negative slope</span> means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> later in this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.</p>
<p id="fs-idm28729904">A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.</p>
<p id="fs-idp29064288">The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as the &#8220;starting point&#8221; and the other point as the &#8220;end point&#8221; and then calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:</p>

<p id="fs-idp75262304">Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next 1,000 meters</p>
<p id="fs-idp3737664">Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has an infinite slope.</p>
<p id="fs-idm8728560">Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.</p>

Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 &#8211; 0.5Qs and the demand curve is P = &#8211;0.4 + 0.2Qd. Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and &#8211;0.4, and the slopes are &#8211;0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp66195488"><h1 data-type="title">Growth Rates</h1>
<p id="fs-idp39003328">Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">growth rate</span> is simply the percentage change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business&#8217;s sales. It could be a nation&#8217;s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idp66186672"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage&#160;change</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Change&#160;in&#160;quantity</mtext><mtext>Quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mtable columnspacing="2px" columnalign="right center left"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage&#160;change</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>&#160;=&#160;</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Change&#160;in&#160;quantity</mtext><mtext>Quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div><p id="fs-idm49335232">Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.</p>
<p id="fs-idm52797040">To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity&#8212;or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation&#8217;s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion &#8211; $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:</p>

If you need a rough approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.</p>
<p id="fs-idm28526496">A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.</p>
<p id="fs-idp26419920">The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm151891888"><h1 data-type="title">Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph</h1><p id="fs-idm159329680">Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.</p>
<p id="fs-idm112471792">Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers&#8217; perceptions of the relationships in the data.</p>

<p id="fs-idm36697552">The graphs we have discussed so far are called <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">line graphs</span>, because they show a relationship between two variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.</p>
<p id="fs-idm75230912">Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in <a href="#Table_A_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is displayed in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">median</span> means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child&#8217;s physical development is roughly on track.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A01_008"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls </div><figcaption>The line graph shows the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years.

In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A01_009"><div data-type="title" class="title">Altitude-Air Density Relationship </div><figcaption>This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter.

<p id="fs-idm12993392">The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent averages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.</p>
<p id="fs-idm20827792">One common line graph is called a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">time series</span>, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008&#8211;2009.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A01_025"><div data-type="title" class="title">U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975&#8211;2014</div><figcaption>This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment data.

In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_021" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures percentages rather than the number of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height, representing 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run his or her eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.</p>

Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and other quantitative categories.</p>

<p id="fs-idp127597376"><strong data-effect="bold">Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp93924688">Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.</p>
<p id="fs-idm32870480">Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_004" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.</p>
<p id="fs-idm23342592">A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the economy.</p><p id="fs-idp26205536"><strong data-effect="bold">How Graphs Can Be Misleading</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp175139536">Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can be done, consider the line graphs of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.

<p id="fs-idm15492352">Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a). <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_022" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.</p>
<p id="fs-idm89821600">A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_025" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (d) makes it look larger.</p>
<p id="fs-idm125921968">Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_023" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year- to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.</p><p id="fs-idm155257232">A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A01_017" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its &#8220;original&#8221; level&#8212;which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.</p><p id="fs-idm64146304">These kinds of tricks&#8212;or shall we just call them &#8220;presentation choices&#8221;&#8212; are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.</p>
<p id="fs-idm134027216">Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.</p>
</section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm123376288"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm44564944">Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.</p>
<p id="fs-idm51750880">Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.</p>
<p id="fs-idp5680752">Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.</p>

<p id="fs-idp37189312">Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people&#8217;s preferences.

This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility&#8212;an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic&#8212;the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">indifference curve</span> framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp76101520"><h1 data-type="title">What Is an Indifference Curve?</h1>
<p id="fs-idp26395136">People cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify what choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example, <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> presents three indifference curves that represent Lilly&#8217;s preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main relaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh) represents one level of utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then we will look at the indifference curves as a group.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_001"><div data-type="title" class="title">Lilly&#8217;s Indifference Curves </div><figcaption>Lilly would receive equal utility from all points on a given indifference curve. Any points on the highest indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points like A, B, C, and D on the middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility than any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idp100366096" data-alt="The graph shows three indifference curves.

<p id="fs-idp18962080"><strong data-effect="bold">The Shape of an Indifference Curve</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp80083344">The indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents a set of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged according to her personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84 doughnuts (point B) from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D). She would also receive the same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference curve.</p>
<p id="eip-473">Indifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right; 2) they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of the other, while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um, which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal utility</span> that Lilly would gain from, say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84&#8212;so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">marginal rate of substitution</span>, which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same. </p><p id="fs-idp27716080">Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape involves diminishing marginal utility&#8212;the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal utility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide Lilly an equal amount of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C and D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts falls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this difference is that points A and C are different starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal utility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will be relatively high while the marginal utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low&#8212;so on the margin, it will take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility from the marginal book. At point C, however, Lilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high&#8212;so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution&#8212;that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant&#8212;also changes, as a result of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">diminishing marginal utility</span> of both goods.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11855696"><strong data-effect="bold">The Field of Indifference Curves</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idm14714032">Each indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will have its own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly&#8217;s preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves lying nestled together on the diagram&#8212;even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three levels of utility, appear on <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn on this diagram&#8212;but you should remember that they exist.</p>
<p id="fs-idp40568336">Higher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, indifference curve Ul can be thought of as a &#8220;low&#8221; level of utility, while Um is a &#8220;medium&#8221; level of utility and Uh is a &#8220;high&#8221; level of utility. All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um, which in turn are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.</p>
<p id="fs-idp103170864">To understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference curve Um to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three) and doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference curve&#8212;that all the points on the curve have the same level of utility&#8212;if point F on indifference curve Uh is preferred to point B on indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh have a higher level of utility than all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve, like Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of both goods. Since one point on the higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and since all the points on a given indifference curve have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on higher indifference curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference curves.</p>
<p id="fs-idm9387904">These arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not require any numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on the assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if they are keeping the same level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they receive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference curves can be mapped out to describe the preferences of any individual.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11794112"><strong data-effect="bold">The Individuality of Indifference Curves</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp80391248">Each person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same general shape&#8212;they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right&#8212;the specific shape of indifference curves can be different for every person. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, for example, applies only to Lilly&#8217;s preferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel through different points.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm112091376"><h1 data-type="title">Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves</h1>
<p id="fs-idm33748048">People seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference curve. However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually possible.</p>

<p id="fs-idp12097456"><strong data-effect="bold">Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp60715712">Return to the situation of Lilly&#8217;s choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6, doughnuts are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_002" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Along with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">budget line</span> are shown the three indifference curves from <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_001" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. What is Lilly&#8217;s utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_002"><div data-type="title" class="title">Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint </div><figcaption>Lilly&#8217;s preferences are shown by the indifference curves. Lilly&#8217;s budget constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is shown by the straight line. Lilly&#8217;s optimal choice will be point B, where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly would have more utility at a point like F on the higher indifference curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher indifference curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on indifference curve Ul and thus provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm37597008" data-alt="The graph shows indifferences curves Ul, Um, and Uh which highlight the following choices based on her options of books (the x-axis) and doughnuts (the y-axis): A (2, 120); B (3, 84); F (5, 100); G (6, 48); H (3, 70).">

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp4802784">The choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference curve Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly&#8217;s budget constraint. The choice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside Lilly&#8217;s budget set, and as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself. Choices B and G are both on the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower indifference curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If Lilly were to start at choice G, and then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from doughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her happier&#8212;which would cause her to move toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly&#8217;s personal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly&#8217;s opportunity set, which is determined by prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.</p>
<p id="fs-idm31026336">The highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an infinite number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there will always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher indifference curves, like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that indifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower indifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference curve crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be another, higher, attainable indifference curve sitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm3420224"><h1 data-type="title">Changes in Income</h1>
<p id="fs-idm93397552">A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the new <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">budget constraint</span> will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve, representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how much will a person alter consumption of books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%? Or will the quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even declines?</p>
<p id="fs-idm91203856">Since personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response to changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a) and <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts that cost $1 and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on Manuel&#8217;s preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set occurs where his opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with three movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha&#8217;s utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be seven movies and 12 yogurts.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_013"><div data-type="title" class="title">Manuel and Natasha&#8217;s Indifference Curves </div><figcaption>Manuel and Natasha originally face the same budget constraints; that is, same prices and same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their preferences are not the same. (a) Manuel&#8217;s original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the higher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha&#8217;s original choice (Y) involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when budget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in response to a change in income.</figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm72005296">Now, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_013" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (a), Manuel&#8217;s new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts&#8212;that is, Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha&#8217;s new utility maximizing choice at Z will be eight movies and 28 yogurts&#8212;that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In this way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are normal goods, then the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them&#8212;although exactly how much more is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response to a higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp140057303235616"><h1 data-type="title">Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects</h1>
<p id="fs-idp140057303201104">A higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower indifference curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the opportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an increased level of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good will depend on personal preferences.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057307596928">Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an income effect. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">substitution effect</span> is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out substitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins. Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If oranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">income effect</span> refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one&#8217;s income. If the price of a good that you have been buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen&#8212;you are able to purchase more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given amount of income is diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the &#8220;income effect&#8221; does not refer to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus the quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It might be more accurate to call the &#8220;income effect&#8221; a &#8220;buying power effect,&#8221; but the &#8220;income effect&#8221; terminology has been used for decades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price changes, consumers feel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057303855376">Using indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. In <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, Ogden faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost $6, and he has $120 to spend.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_005"><div data-type="title" class="title">Substitution and Income Effects </div><figcaption>The original choice is A, the point of tangency between the original budget constraint and indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows the new higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The substitution effect is the shift from A to C, which means getting fewer haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in buying power that causes a shift from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative prices remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed of both goods. Both substitution and income effects cause fewer haircuts to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and income effect cancel out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.</figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idp140057303335136" data-alt="The graph shows two indifference curves with points A (10, 3) and B (10, 2) marked on the curves.

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp140057303178336">The price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higher <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">opportunity set</span> and the higher indifference curve. After the price of pizza increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with three haircuts and 10 personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back only on haircuts, while leaving his consumption of pizza unchanged.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308914288">The dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect. To understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would Ogden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative prices did not affect his utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two goods; thus, the slope of the original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of the new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a graphical tool inserted in a specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original level of utility or buying power.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308914672">Thus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that Ogden would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set and the dashed line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference curve). The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively more expensive&#8212;in Ogden&#8217;s case, the haircuts on the vertical axis&#8212;and toward the good which has become relatively less expensive&#8212;in this case, the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with &#8220;s&#8221; for &#8220;substitution effect,&#8221; one on each axis, show the direction of this movement.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057303335264">The income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his buying power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the relative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where the price of one good increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both goods should fall (if they are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to believe otherwise). The two arrows labeled with &#8220;i&#8221; for &#8220;income effect,&#8221; one on each axis, show the direction of this income effect movement.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057311359168">Now, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed less of it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume less and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza meant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza meant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_005" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, in this particular example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden&#8217;s consumption of haircuts are offsetting&#8212;so he ends up consuming the same quantity of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057308919008">The size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual preferences. For example, if Ogden&#8217;s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially strong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts. This case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods. In this case, his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left of choice B on the new budget constraint.</p>
<p id="fs-idp140057311419728">Although the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be remembered that they are twin components of a single cause&#8212;a change in price. Although you can analyze them separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp136737136"><h1 data-type="title">Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices</h1>
<p id="fs-idp85077728">The concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure choice or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an intertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that provide a certain level of utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves&#8212;downward sloping, steeper on the left and flatter on the right&#8212;also remain the same.</p>

<p id="fs-idp75821024"><strong data-effect="bold">A Labor-Leisure Example</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp174073152">Petunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family responsibilities and sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, the highest level of utility for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the lower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income of $600 per week (that is, 50 hours of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget constraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and works 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours of work at $20 per hour).</p>

The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to the right, so that she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this case, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more income, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income effect in this example leads to greater consumption of both goods. Overall, in this example, income rises because of both substitution and income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution effect but increases because of the income effect&#8212;leading, in Petunia&#8217;s case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure consumed.</figcaption>

In this case, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more income, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B."></img>

<p id="fs-idp63146000">Substitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly wage. The dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.</p>
<p id="fs-idp176034368">The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at the same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">labor-leisure diagram</span> is determined by the wage rate. Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or &#8220;buying power.&#8221; The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income. The &#8220;s&#8221; arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.</p>
<p id="fs-idp225599456">The income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it possible for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point B; that is, it shows how Petunia&#8217;s behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or &#8220;buying power,&#8221; with the wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget constraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn with arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<p id="fs-idp161411424">Putting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This movement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made income relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it possible to have more income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more leisure because, according to Petunia&#8217;s preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure is stronger than the substitution effect that encourages choosing less leisure.</p>
<p id="fs-idp71941920"><a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_006" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> represents only Petunia&#8217;s preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a person whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a higher wage with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of the higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose substitution effect on leisure outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice like F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent these different preferences, you could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget constraint at D or F, rather than at B.</p>
<p id="fs-idp142022384"><strong data-effect="bold">An Intertemporal Choice Example</strong></p>
<p id="fs-idp104330528">Quentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and then will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn a total 80% rate of return. <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows Quentin&#8217;s budget constraint and his indifference curves between present consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his original intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for the future, and expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000 in current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).</p>
<p id="fs-idp135883616">However, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic expectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget constraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will Quentin react to the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of substitution and income effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various choices. The dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully inserted with the same slope as the new opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no change in utility or &#8220;buying power.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp95696656">The substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return makes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The movement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present consumption and less future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The substitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> show the direction of the substitution effect motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should consume more in the present and less in the future.</p>
<p id="fs-idp129910944">Quentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left, which means that Quentin&#8217;s utility or &#8220;buying power&#8221; is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods) encourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present and future consumption in this example is shown with &#8220;i&#8221; arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_007" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

The dashed line is drawn parallel to the new budget set, so that its slope reflects the lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference curve.

The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in utility or &#8220;buying power&#8221; that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the relative price the same. It means less present and less future consumption. In the move from A to B, the substitution effect on present consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is more present consumption.

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp62769120">Taking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less future consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is encouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him to a lower level of utility. For Quentin&#8217;s personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall, he reacts to the lower rate of return with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However, other people might have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same level of present consumption and savings at choice D, or by choosing less present consumption and more savings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a lower rate of return on present consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm95344128"><h1 data-type="title">Sketching Substitution and Income Effects</h1>
<p id="fs-idm120124528">Indifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility. They eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the complementary motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return&#8212;namely, the substitution and income effects.</p>
<p id="fs-idp45220496">If you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the points of tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.</p>

<p id="fs-idm40391616">Step 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call &#8220;candy&#8221; and &#8220;movies.&#8221; Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be tangent&#8212;but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_008" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_008"><div data-type="title" class="title"></div><figcaption></figcaption>
    <span data-type="media" id="fs-idm96048096" data-alt="The graph&#8217;s x-axis is labeled &#8220;candy,&#8221; and the y-axis is labeled &#8220;movies.&#8221; The graphs shows one downward sloping line with the point A marked.">
      <img src="../resources/159b9db965c863d1b15d6366a06692b905efbf39" data-media-type="image/jpeg" alt="The graph&#8217;s x-axis is labeled &#8220;candy,&#8221; and the y-axis is labeled &#8220;movies.&#8221; The graphs shows one downward sloping line with the point A marked."></img>
    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm89857856">Step 2. Now the price of movies changes: let&#8217;s say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that the higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower indifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_009" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

The other endpoint of this new line is lower on the y-axis than the one from Step 1."></img>
    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm97012240">Step 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line, parallel to the new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two changes: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices&#8212;with the level of utility remaining unchanged&#8212;which is the substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting from one indifference curve to the other&#8212;with relative prices staying unchanged&#8212;which is the income effect. The dashed line is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A, but not directly through point A. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_010" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_010"><div data-type="title" class="title"></div><figcaption></figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idp46369712">Step 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget line and to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where the original indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve through A and C. The substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as prices change but the level of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to less consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by the &#8220;s&#8221; (substitution) arrow on the vertical axis, and more consumed of the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the &#8220;s&#8221; arrow on the horizontal axis. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_011" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p><figure id="CNX_Econ_A06_011"><div data-type="title" class="title"></div><figcaption></figcaption>

    </span>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm151335216">Step 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set. When you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger impact on the good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical line with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect on the horizontal axis. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the substitution effect will exceed the income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A, then the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B, showing how choices shifted as a result of the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels of utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the negative income effect means less consumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the &#8220;i&#8221; (income effect) arrows on the vertical and horizontal axes. See <a href="#CNX_Econ_A06_012" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

  </figure>
<p id="fs-idm96990912">In sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following variations: (1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the horizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income effect exceeds the substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.</p>
<p id="fs-idm47230608">One final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the original budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line. Some students find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative sizes of the substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.</p>
</section>







<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm18105360"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm11709600">An indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All points along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent higher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points along the curve, a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an increase in the quantity of the good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on the far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal utility.</p>
<p id="fs-idm26507184">The utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget constraint touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy less of what is relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if utility falls (if they are both normal goods).</p>
<p id="fs-idm42064832">In a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of a wage increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity cost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.</p>
<p id="fs-idm19851904">In an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now cheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost of present consumption in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.</p>

<p id="fs-idp134894416">As explained in <a href="/contents/de7f5785-c957-444b-839c-9082d9670a39@2" class="target-chapter">Financial Markets</a>, the prices of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">stocks</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">bonds</span> depend on future events. The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm. The concept of a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">present discounted value (PDV)</span>, which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation will require an
<span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">interest rate</span>. For example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year from now will have a present discounted value of $100&#8212;that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we will show how to apply it to a bond.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm37811152"><h1 data-type="title">Applying Present Discounted Value to a Stock</h1>
<p id="fs-idm32301200">Consider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that the founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be disbanded. The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in the present, $20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as dividends to shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock in this company?</p>
<p id="fs-idp104256688">A financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an interest rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment opportunities, which is the opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is, using a higher interest rate than the rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In this example, say that the financial investor decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future payments is 15%.</p>
<p id="fs-idp68435776"><a href="#Table_D_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when a benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:</p>

<p id="fs-idp7437008">Next, add up all the present values for the different time periods to get a final answer. The present value calculations ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that a different PDV calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide the PDV of total profits by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price per share should be about $256,500 per share.</p>
<p id="fs-idp55661344">Of course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest rate to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital gains from the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these issues are exactly why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are more optimistic about its future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to pay in the present for a stream of benefits to be received in the future.</p>

<p id="fs-idm9262656">A similar calculation works in the case of bonds. <a href="/contents/de7f5785-c957-444b-839c-9082d9670a39@2" class="target-chapter">Financial Markets</a> explains that if the interest rate falls after a bond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face value. Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate, and the bond will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.</p><p id="fs-idm75850240">Think about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year, the bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 &#215; 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in interest, plus the $3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate is 8%. Then, recalculate if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these calculations, look at the stream of payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what they are worth in present discounted value terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are shown in <a href="#Table_D_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idm48835696">The first calculation shows that the present value of a $3,000 bond, issued at 8%, is just $3,000. After all, that is how much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the lender. The bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want to borrow in the present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present value of what will be repaid to the lender.</p>
<p id="fs-idm70689696">The second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar payments in the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value of those payments, now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments that the bond is receiving have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment&#8217;s value has fallen.</p>
<p id="fs-idp12705744">Again, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in the market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the price of a bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp21804864"><h1 data-type="title">Other Applications</h1>
<p id="fs-idm86792288">Present discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business thinks about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that investment to the present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to, for example, add safety features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits received in the future. Some academic disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon dioxide emissions because of the risk that they will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades in the future, turn on how one compares present costs of pollution control with long-run future benefits. Someone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string of payments over 30 years might be interested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments. Whenever a string of costs and benefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted value becomes an indispensable tool of analysis.</p>
