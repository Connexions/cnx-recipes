- It is recommened to check the browser and PDF output both frequently to ensure that your style is appearing as you intend in the PDF

## More Context

The purpose of this task is to guage your profiency in CSS, Git/Github, and the command line. It also gives you a glimpse of the type of work you would be doing as a memeber of the styles team. 

When creating new styles for books, we are typicaly given design specifications such as the font size, font weight, color, and so on. But, there are still many CSS properties that you must come up with yourself to acheive the desired visual effect. 

A broad overview of a typical workflow for implementing a new design is as follows: 

- New design presented to team by product manager in a card on Zenhub
- A developer on the styles team will review the card and ask any inital questions that they may have about the design and specs provided 
- The developer will implement the style as closely as possible using the design specs provided and any additional information given by the product manager 
- The developer submits a screenshot of their final implementation to the product manager for design review and the product manager provides feedback
