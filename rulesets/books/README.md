# TitleContent

This is a map whose keys are the `className` of the element that will be created (ie `os-divider` or `os-number`) and the values are the css that will be used (ie `"|"` or `counter(exercise)`).

Example:

```scss
(
  os-title-label: "Example",
  os-divider: " ",
  os-number: counter(chapter) "." counter(example),
  os-divider: ":",
)
```


# Page

These are the end-of-chapter/book pages that are autogenerated.

A `Page` contains the following fields:
- `className`: the class name (and bucket) of the page
- `name`: The title of the new page (TODO rename?)
- `hasSolutions`: `true` when this item contains exercises that contain solutions
  - (TODO: why is this necessary?)
- `sectionSeparated`: `true` when items on this page should be organized by Section
  - A header is added which contains the section number and title
- `chapterSeparated`: `true` when items on this page should be organized by Chapter (only for end-of-book Pages)
  - A header is added which contains the section number and title
- `specialPageType`: (optional) There are also a couple of "special" pages: `$PAGE_INDEX` and `$PAGE_GLOSSARY`
which contain additional configuration fields.

Also, a set of styleguide comments occur above for each composite page.
Having it here makes it easy to remember to update the documentation and by having it above the `$Config_ChapterCompositePages` helps make this area
more readable (since it sort of looks like a table).


# TargetLabel

Configure the labels of links. You will likely just extend the default set with a label for items specific to this book, like links to `Try It` notes.

(TODO: maybe this should be the default for links to Notes?)
**NOTE:** These selectors MUST match the counting selectors or be more specific
otherwise, the increment and the counter() call may fire in the wrong order.

A `TargetLabel` contains the following fields:

- `selector`: This a selector that matches the target of a link
- `labelText`: This is the text that will be inside the link


# Note

These are a Set of "Feature boxes" that are specific to the book.

A `Note` contains the following fields:
- `className`: the class name of the Note
- `moveSolutionTo`: Where the solution can be moved to.
  - `$AREA_NONE` keeps the solution in place
  - `$AREA_TRASH` discards the solution
  - `$AREA_EOC` moves the solutions to the end of a chapter
  - `$AREA_EOB` moves the solutions to the end of the book
- `labelText`: A simple string for the title. cannot be used with `titleContent`
- `titleContent`: what the autogenerated title should look like.
  - Most notes are just a string but some, like "Try It"
    are prefaced with which section they occur in
- `counterName`: (optional) used in conjunction with titleContent to specify the name of the counter


# UnnumberedExercise

Sometimes exercises in notes should not be numbered. This shows which ones.
TODO: It would be nice to move these into the note config but it seems like
the context is not always a note, and the child is not always an exercise.
so the proper place to put this requires a bit more thought

It contains the following fields:

- `contextSelector`
- `childSelector`: (optional)


# CustomPart

This contains additional elements in the book (like an equation, exercises, solutions)
Each entry has a few common fields that can be set:
- `moveTo`: specifies where to move this element to
- `resetAt`: specifies when the counters should reset
  - `$RESET_CHAPTER` resets for each chapter
  - `$RESET_COMPOSITE_PAGE` resets for each autogenerated page
- `titleContent`: The generated title for this element

- `outlineTitle`: (optional) Only used by `Chapter`
- `numberAt`: (optional) Only used by `Exercise`
- `solutionTitleContent`: (optional) Only used by `Example`
- `excludeNumberingInClassName`: (optional) Only used by `Equation`
