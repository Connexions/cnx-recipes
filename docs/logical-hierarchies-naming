Problem: Names vs Behavior (strict typing vs duck typing)


Use naming conventions, human language for now

Archive > Series > Book > Unit > Chapter > Page (smallest unit) > Section > Sub section > sub sub section > ....

C < P 
U < C/P
B < U/C/P
S < B/U/C/P

Creating special chapters 'appendix', special page 'preface', based on rules above. A page can be right under a book, but a unit cannot be in a chapter for example. 


Long term/TBD: 
Use underlying structure: bottom up logic, knowing how many parents one elements has, not limited to position in DOM as opposed to how many children one element has

L6 > L5 > L4 > L3 > L2 > L1

Matching the two in the definitions, allowing users to label them whatever they want (titles are generated by content, never by css), use data-labels instead of data-type, refer to elements by level instead of names. Need a reference, conufusing for developers
