# About the Recipes

The generated CSS is stored in the [./output](./output) directory.

## Relevant Scripts

```sh
./script/fetch-html ${book_name}     # Stores result in `./data/`
./script/bake-book ${book_name}      # Uses the results of `./script/fetch-html`
./script/build-guide ${book_name}
```


# Guide Documentation

The source for the documentation is in CSS comments and is split into `common` and book-specific.

[An example config file with documentation](./books/_example/)

## Directory Organizational Map

- `./recipes/mixins/styleguide/*.snippet.xml` : The Raw HTML snippets for "common" elements in a Page
- `./recipes/mixins/styleguide/_all.scss`: The documentation for "common" elements in a Page
- `./recipes/books/${book_name}/styleguide/*.snippet.xml` : The Raw HTML snippets for book-specific collated pages and any other customizations
- `./recipes/books/${book_name}/book.scss`: Added CSS docs that are slurped in when generating the styleguide

## Book-Agnostic Documentation

The common documentation is in `./recipes/mixins/styleguide/_all.scss` only because phil didn't know of a better place to put them but wanted them "near" the common code. That directory also contains the Raw HTML snippets.

## Book-Specific Documentation

The book-specific documentation is done as comments in the `./recipes/books/${book_name}/book.scss` and `./recipes/books/${book_name}/_config.scss` files and the Raw HTML snippets are in `./books/${book_name}/styleguide/`.


# Variable Naming Conventions

There are 4 different types of variables used in the SASS files:

- starts with `Config_`: these are defined in the config file and are the **only** ones used as input to `_generator.scss`
- `$UPPER_CASE`: these are enums (SASS does not have native enums) and are used when you must select 1 of several options.
    - Example: `$AREA_NONE`, `$AREA_EOC`, `$AREA_EOB`
- `$_privateVar`: these are declared and used **within** the SCSS file
- `$PascalCase`: these are defined in one `_config.scss` file but are used in another `_config.scss` file


# Config Settings Hierarchy

The config settings are variables that start with `$Config_` and have the following structure:

# Languages

Some languages have different ways of conjugating a noun, depending on the sentence. The text inside links is autogenerated so to support language variants, these 3 things happen:

- a link in the content contains an additional attribute `{http://katalysteducation.org/cmlnle/1.0}case` which contains a string.
- the recipe contains a mapping from the case to the characters that should be used for the word (`$GRAMMATICAL_CASES`)
- the link text generator uses the mapping when generating a link (`$Config_TargetLabels`)

Pseudo-example:

```less
a:target-is-a(figure) {
    &[cmlnle|case="nominative"]   { content: "Rysunek" }
    &[cmlnle|case="genitive"]     { content: "Rysunku" }
    &[cmlnle|case="dative"]       { content: "Rysunkowi" }
    &[cmlnle|case="accusative"]   { content: "Rysunek" }
    &[cmlnle|case="instrumental"] { content: "Rysunkiem" }
    &[cmlnle|case="locative"]     { content: "Rysunku" }
    &[cmlnle|case="vocative"]     { content: "Rysunku" }
}
```


# Composite Chapter

Defined in `$Config_hasCompositeChapter`.

- not sure if this is the same thing as a ChapterCompositePages
- add an h1 for each one (e.g. "Key Terms", "Index")
- heading levels are "sane" meaning they are nested properly in the baked file (composite chapter title is like h2 and the compositepage inside it is h3 for accessibility)
- copy the book metadata into each composite pages (this is because the code that imports back into the DB requires a metadata element)
- implicitly, a non-leaf entry is added to the ToC


# Composite Page

These are autogenerated Pages which are created as part of the baking process.

Defined in `$Config_ChapterCompositePages`.

A list of Pages
- composite pages are given an id attribute so that they can be linked to from the ToC
- create a Page (contains a data-uuid-key, title, metadata, etc) whose contents is collected from items that match `className` from each entry in the list

A `Page` contains the following fields:
- `$page.className`: the class name (and bucket) of the page
- `$page.name`: The title of the new page (TODO rename?)
- `$page.hasSolutions`: `true` when this item contains exercises that contain solutions
    - (TODO: why is this necessary?)
- `$page.clusterBy`: `$CLUSTER_SECTION`, `$CLUSTER_CHAPTER`, or `$CLUSTER_NONE` when items on this page should be organized by Section/Chapter
    - A header is added which contains the section number and title
- `$page.specialPageType`: (optional) There are also a few "special" pages which contain additional configuration fields: 
    - `$PAGE_INDEX`
    - `$PAGE_GLOSSARY`
    - `$PAGE_INDEX_PARTIAL` : A few books contain multiple indexes. Each term contains an attribute that defines which index it should be added to (`[cxlxt|index]`)
        - `$page.indexType`: which type of index this is. This string should match the possible values of the `term/@cxlxt:index` attribute on each term.
        - `$page.defaultIndex`: `true` if this index is the default. Terms that do not have a `cxlxt:index="..."` attribute on them will be added to this index (hopefully there is only one default index!) 
    - `$PAGE_CITATIONS` : collects each note that has a class name of `$page.className`
- `$page.childPages`: (optional) Some generated pages are just a container for other Pages. This contains the list of child Pages that need to be generated


## Clustering & Examples

When content in the page is collated, it can be grouped by which section the content originally came from or not.
This is defined by the `$page.clusterBy` value:

<details>
<summary>
<strong>No clustering</strong> (click me to see more)
</summary>

This is defined by the value `$page.clusterBy == $CLUSTER_NONE`.

Example HTML that is injected:

```xml
<!-- <div data-type="chapter"> -->
<!-- ... Normal chapter content -->
    <div data-type="page" id="{generate-id()}" class="{$page.className}">
        <h#>{page.name}</h#>

        <!-- bucket contents -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex1 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex2 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex3 ...</div> -->

    </div>
<!-- </chapter> -->
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Cluster by Section</strong> (click me to see more)
</summary>

This is defined by the value `$page.clusterBy == $CLUSTER_SECTION`.

```xml
<!-- <div data-type="chapter"> -->
<!-- ... Normal chapter content -->
    <div data-type="page" id="{generate-id()}" class="{$page.className}">
        <h1>{page.name}</h1>

        <!-- bucket contents grouped by which section it came from -->
        <h2><a href="#...">4.1 Kinematics in One Dimension</a></h2>
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex1 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex2 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex3 ...</div> -->

        <h2><a href="#...">4.2 Kinematics in Two Dimensions</h2>
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex1 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex2 ...</div> -->
        <!-- <div data-type="section"> Ex3 ...</div> -->

    </div>
<!-- </chapter> -->
```

</details>


# Section Composite Pages

Defined in `$Config_SectionCompositePages`. A list of [Pages](#page)

Each one has a `h1[data-type="document-title"]` added to it.

We create a Page, moves exercises to it, optionally group the exercises by section, and add the section title to the group (with a link back to the section)

Exercises within a section composite page is numbered elsewhere.


# Book Composite Pages

Defined in `$Config_BookCompositePages`. A list of [Pages](#page)

These tend to be Indexes, an Answer Key, a References Page, or a book-wide Glossary.


## Index

An index links to all terms in the book. The terms are sorted alphabetically but there is a language-specific regular expression that defines what goes in the Symbols section (`$Config_Index_SymbolRegexp` and `$Config_Index_NotSymbolRegexp`). A book may have **multiple indexes**.

An index is defined by this value: `$page.specialPageType == $PAGE_INDEX`.

Here is a quick "template" of an index followed by a more concrete example:

```
<h#>Index</h#>
<div.group-by>
    <span.group-label>A</>
    <span.os-index-item>
    <span.os-term group-by="A">Accessibility Improvements</>
    <a.os-term-section-link href="..." >
        <span.os-term-section>Preface</>
    </>
    <span.os-index-link-separator>,</>
    </>
</>
<div.group-by>
    <span.group-label>B</>
    ...
</>
```


```xml
<!-- <body> -->
<!-- ... Chapters and Appendixes -->

<div data-type="composite-page" data-uuid-key="index" class="os-eob os-{$page.specialPageType}-container">
    <h1 data-type="document-title">{$page.name}</h1>
    <!-- metadata copied from the book but the title is replaced with "Index" -->
    <div data-type="metadata" style="display: none;">...</div>

    <div class="group-by">
        <span class="group-label">Symbols</span>
        <div class="os-index-item">
            <span class="os-term">{$theTermName}</span>
            <a href="#{$uniqueIdToTheTerm}" class="os-term-section-link">{$autogeneratedLinkTextToTheSection}</a>
        </div>
        <div class="os-index-item"><!-- 1998 Telecommunications Act --></div>
        <div class="os-index-item"><!-- +1 Spin --></div>
    </div>

    <div class="group-by"><!-- A --></div>
    <div class="group-by"><!-- B --></div>
    <div class="group-by"><!-- C --></div>
    <div class="group-by"><!-- D --></div>
</div>
<!-- </body> -->
```

### Additional things pertaining to an Index

Add an autogenerated id attribute to each term that does not have one because we will link to it from the index


## Answer Key

This is used when generating the answer key at the back of the book. Answers are grouped by chapter.

It is defined by both of the following values: `$page.clusterBy == $CLUSTER_CHAPTER` and `$page.chapterPages == true`

<details>
<summary>
Example (click me to see more)
</summary>

```xml
<!-- <body> -->
<!-- ... Normal book content including Appendixes but not the Index -->
    <div data-type="composite-page" data-uuid-key=".{$page.className}" id="{generate-id()}" class="os-{$page.className}-container">
        <!-- metadata copied from the book but the title is replaced with "Index" -->
        <div data-type="metadata" style="display: none;">...</div>

        <h1 data-type="document-title">{page.name}</h1>

        <!-- bucket contents grouped by which chapter it came from -->
        <div data-type="page" data-uuid-key="..." id="{generate-id()}">
            <h2><a href="#...">4 Kinematics</a></h2>
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.1 C ...</div> -->
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.2 C ...</div> -->
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.3 C ...</div> -->
        </div>
        
        <div data-type="page" data-uuid-key="..." id="{generate-id()}">
            <h2><a href="#...">5 Force</a></h2>
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.1 C ...</div> -->
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.2 C ...</div> -->
            <!-- <div data-type="section"> 4.3 C ...</div> -->
        </div>
    </div>
<!-- </body> -->
```

</details>

# ToC

The recipe optionally does the following to the Table of Contents:
- Add the word "Contents" when `$Config_TocTitleWord == true`
- Unwrap the span elements in the ToC (a feature flag in the Carnival theme)

Autogenerated Pages are added to the Table Of Contents and the titles of existing pages are updated to contain the numbering.

# Unit

The Unit occurs in some books and Units group chapters together. The recipe specifies the formatting of the Unit title in `$Config_PartType_Unit_TitleContent`. See [TitleContent](#titlecontent).

This is a list of pairs where the key is the class name of the element that will be generated. Example `(os-number:"Unit " counter(unit), os-divider: ' ' )` ends up becoming:

```html
<span class="os-number">Unit 4</span><span class="os-divider"> </span>
```


# Preface

Change the `<.preface><data-type="document-title">` to a `<.preface><h1 data-type="document-title">`

In some books (anatomy) the Preface Abstract is discarded via `$Config_TrashSelectedElements`.


# Appendix
`$Config_PartType_Appendix_TitleContent` contains the formatting for an Appendix title. See [TitleContent](#titlecontent)
Usually the formatting ends up being `<.os-number>Appendix B</><.os-divider> </>`.

Appendixes are numbered using this variable. It adds `<.os-number>Appendix M</><.os-divider> </>` to `[data-type="document-title"]`

TODO: Not sure where these two came from. Look at the commit
- Section titles are converted from an `<h1 data-type="document-title">` to a `<div data-type=...>`
- Section titles are converted from a `<h1 data-type="document-title" itemprop="name">` to a `<span.os-text data-type="" itemprop="">`

# Chapter
`$Config_PartType_Chapter_TitleContent` contains the formatting for a Chapter title. See [TitleContent](#titlecontent)
Usually the formatting ends up being `<.os-number>Chapter 1</><.os-divider> </>`.

Additionally, the title of a chapter (`[data-type="document-title"]`) gets an id attribute (assuming so that we can link to it but not sure)

`$Config_PartType_Chapter` is a [CustomPart](#custompart)
- if `outlineTitle == true`, it causes the `.os-chapter-outline` to move **into** the top of the `.introduction` Page
- if `outlineTitle == true` _and_ `hasLearningObjectives == true` then the abstract is wrapped in a `<div class="learning-objective">` element

An autogenerated chapter outline is added (old books use this). Newer books then remove this.

Example Chapter Outline:

```html
<div class="os-chapter-outline">
    <h3 class="os-title">Chapter Outline</h3>
    <div class="os-chapter-objective">
        <a class="os-chapter-objective" href="#auto_m67832_32814">
            <span class="os-number">1.1</span><span class="os-divider"> </span><span class="os-text">Konematics in 1 Dimension</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    ...
</div>
```


# Section

Section titles are converted from an `<h2 ...>` to a `<div ...>`.

The exact value of the Section title is defined by`$Config_PartType_Section_TitleContent`. See [TitleContent](#titlecontent).
Usually the formatting ends up being `<.os-number>1.6</>`.

The title of the section is replaced with the title of the section in the ToC and is wrapped with an `<h#>`.

A `.chapter-content-module` class is added to the section.

Example:

```html
<!-- Raw -->
<div data-type="document-title" id="auto_m68867_87869">Introduction: Ionization Constants of Weak Bases</div>

<!-- Baked -->
<div data-type="document-title" id="auto_m68867_87869"><h1 data-type="document-title" itemprop="name">Ionization Constants of Weak Bases</h1></div>
```


# Table

There are several variations of tables for different books depending on whether the table contains a caption, a title, and whether the caption/title are both above/below or one is above and the other is below.

The variations are configured in `$Config_SetTableCaption`:

- `$Config_SetTableCaption.hasCaption`: boolean
- `$Config_SetTableCaption.hasTitle`: boolean
- `$Config_SetTableCaption.hasTopTitle`: boolean

When the title and caption are both above or below the table then the title and caption are wrapped together in an element.

In order to provide a title, every table is wrapped inside a `div.os-table` (for styling and REX depends on this for search) and inject a `.os-table-title` child.

Generate a summary attribute using the table's caption and onto the newly-created `div.os-table` wrapper.

When `$Config_PartType_Table_...hasTopTitle == true` and the table content has a `.top-titled` class on it then move the first `th` into a newly-created title element:

Example:

```html
<!-- Raw -->
<table class="top-titled">
    <thead><tr><th>I AM THE TITLE</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody><tr><td>Body</td></tr></tbody>
    <caption>this is in the table caption</caption>
</table>

<!-- Baked -->
<div class="os-table" summary="this is in the table caption">
    <div class="os-table-title">Table 1.4 I AM THE TITLE</div>

    <table class="top-titled">
        <tbody><tr><td>Body</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="os-caption">this is in the table caption</div>
</div>
```

When `$Config_SetTableCaption.hasTopTitle` is set do all of the following:
    - move the title above the table instead of below it
    - delete the `thead` when the FEATURE_FLAG table-move-fake-title is set
    - wrap the title in a `.os-table-title` FOR_STYLING_ONLY

Table captions in a Chapter are defined in `$Config_PartType_Table_CaptionContent`. See [TitleContent](#titlecontent)

Table captions in an Appendix are defined in `$Config_PartType_Table_CaptionContentAp`. Usually just the counter changes (e.g. `A3` instead of `4.3`)


# Figure

Similar to a [Table](#table), a figure may have a title or caption and they can be placed above/below the figure.

Therefore, a figure is wrapped in a `div.os-figure` and the placement of the Title and Caption are defined by `$Config_SetFigureCaption` similar to a [Table](#table)

Additionally, the recipe adds an additional class to splash images.

Variables:

- `$Config_SetFigureCaption`: A [Caption](#caption)
- `$Config_PartType_Figure`
- `$Config_PartType_Figure_CaptionContent`: A [TitleContent](#titlecontent)
- `$Config_PartType_Figure_CaptionContentAp`: A [TitleContent](#titlecontent)


# Note
- `$Config_Notes`: A list of [Notes](#note)
- Every note changes from `<data-type="note"><data-type="title" id>X</>Y</>` to `<data-type="note"><h#.os-title data-type="title"><span.os-title-label id>X</></><div.os-note-body>Y</></>`

# Exercise


## Solution
- `$Config_PartType_Solution`: A [CustomPart](#custompart)
- change the solutions exercise number (`<span.os-number>12</>`) into a link back to the exercise
- add `.os-has-solution` to the exercise if it contains a solution and if the recipe is not discarding all solutions
- wrap the solution content in an element (e.g. from `<data-type="solution">...</>` to `<data-type="solution"><div.os-solution-container>...</></>`)

# Equation
- `$Config_PartType_Equation`: A [CustomPart](#custompart)

# Example
- `$Config_PartType_Example`: A [CustomPart](#custompart)
- Examples are Numbered. The numbering can be set to reset at the section or not (`resetAt`)
  - `<.os-title><.os-title-label>Example </><.os-number>B12</><.os-divider> </.os-divider></>`
- Feature flags define whether Examples in an Appendix are numbered or not (`appendix-has-numbered-examples`) and if the subtitle is numbered (`subtitled-examples`)
- Change the subtitle from a span to an `<h#>` (flag: `subtitled-examples`)
- Wrap the contents of an example with `<div.body>`

# Link
- `$Config_TargetLabels`: A list of [TargetLabels](#targetlabel)
- Replace link text from `[link]` to text specific to the target (e.g. `Figure 4.3` or `9.1 Kinematics`)

# Misc
## Unnumbered
- `$Config_UnnumberedElements`: A list of [UnnumberedElements](#unnumberedelements)

- `$Config_PartType_*`
  - FOR_STYLING_ONLY: gets a class on it when it has a FirstElement
- `$Config_Coverage_*`
  - `$Config_Coverage_MayHaveSimlinks`: a boolean
    - change `<a.os-interactive-link/>` to `<a.os-interactive-link target="_blank"/>`
  - `$Config_Coverage_MayHaveIframes`: a boolean
    - add attributes on the iframe parent so that CSS can choose which alternative to show from several different options without relying on `:has(...)`
      - change `<iframe/>` to `<data-type="alternatives" .os-has-iframe.os-has-link.os-has-image><iframe.os-is-iframe/><a.os-is-link/><img.os-is-image/></>` 
  - `$Config_Coverage_MayHaveMissingExercises`: a boolean
- `$Config_HACK_modifyAnyContainerTitleSelector`: a boolean
- `$Config_hasCompositeAppendixes`: a boolean (used for some TEA books)
- `$Config_hasCitation`: a boolean used for References.
- `$Config_addSolutionHeader`
  - seems to define whether solutions are discarded or kept
- `$Config_hasStimuli`



## TitleContent

This is a map whose keys are the `className` of the element that will be created (ie `os-divider` or `os-number`) and the values are the css that will be used (ie `"|"` or `counter(exercise)`).

Example:

```scss
(
  os-title-label: "Example",
  os-divider: " ",
  os-number: counter(chapter) "." counter(example),
  os-divider: ":",
)
```


## Page

These are the end-of-chapter/book pages that are autogenerated.

A `Page` contains the following fields:
- `className`: the class name (and bucket) of the page
- `name`: The title of the new page (TODO rename?)
- `hasSolutions`: `true` when this item contains exercises that contain solutions
  - (TODO: why is this necessary?)
- `clusterBy`: `$CLUSTER_SECTION`, `$CLUSTER_CHAPTER`, or `$CLUSTER_NONE` when items on this page should be organized by Section/Chapter
  - A header is added which contains the section number and title
- `specialPageType`: (optional) There are also a couple of "special" pages: `$PAGE_INDEX` and `$PAGE_GLOSSARY`
which contain additional configuration fields.
- `childPages`: (optional) Some generated pages are just a container for other Pages. This contains the list of child Pages that need to be generated

Also, a set of styleguide comments occur above for each composite page.
Having it here makes it easy to remember to update the documentation and by having it above the `$Config_ChapterCompositePages` helps make this area
more readable (since it sort of looks like a table).


## Caption

This configures a Table or Figure caption.

A `Caption` contains the following fields:

- `captionType`: whether this is for a table or a figure
  - `$CAPTION_TABLE`
  - `$CAPTION_FIGURE`
- `defaultContainer`: An element that is created to contain the caption
- `hasCaption`: a boolean
- `hasTitle`: a boolean
- `resetAt`: en enum. The numbering either resets at the chapter (empty) or at the section (`moduleReset`)

## TargetLabel

Configure the labels of links. You will likely just extend the default set with a label for items specific to this book, like links to `Try It` notes.

(TODO: maybe this should be the default for links to Notes?)
**NOTE:** These selectors MUST match the counting selectors or be more specific
otherwise, the increment and the counter() call may fire in the wrong order.

A `TargetLabel` contains the following fields:

- `selector`: This a selector that matches the target of a link
- `labelText`: This is the text that will be inside the link
  - It can be a list or a map. If it is a map (used in i18n), the key corresponds to the `@cmlnle:case="..."` attribute. see #353


## Note

These are a Set of "Feature boxes" that are specific to the book.

A `Note` contains the following fields:
- `className`: the class name of the Note
- `moveSolutionTo`: Where the solution can be moved to.
  - `$AREA_NONE` keeps the solution in place
  - `$AREA_TRASH` discards the solution
  - `$AREA_EOC` moves the solutions to the end of a chapter
  - `$AREA_EOB` moves the solutions to the end of the book
- One of the following:
  - `useHeader`
  - `replaceHeader`
    - `labelText`: A simple string for the title. cannot be used with `titleContent`
      - Wrap the note body with a `<.os-note-body>` and create a `<h#.os-title data-type="title">{labelText}</>` as the first child of the note
    - `titleContent`: what the autogenerated title should look like.
      - Most notes are just a string but some, like "Try It"
        are prefaced with which section they occur in

- `counterName`: (optional) used in conjunction with titleContent to specify the name of the counter



## UnnumberedExercise

Sometimes exercises (or equations) in notes should not be numbered. This shows which ones.

The name of this type is currently a little confusing but it is this because the need for unnumbered Exercises came before the need for unnumbered Equations.

TODO: It would be nice to move these into the note config but it seems like
the context is not always a note, and the child is not always an exercise/equation.
so the proper place to put this requires a bit more thought

It contains the following fields:

- `contextSelector`
- `childSelector`: (optional)


## CustomPart

This contains additional elements in the book (like an equation, exercises, solutions)
Each entry has a few common fields that can be set:
- `moveTo`: specifies where to move this element to
  - `$AREA_TRASH_HALF` (only for Config_PartType_Solution) will mark half of solutions for deletion before collation to the answer key
- `resetAt`: specifies when the counters should reset
  - `$RESET_SECTION` resets for each module
  - `$RESET_CHAPTER` resets for each chapter
  - `$RESET_COMPOSITE_PAGE` resets for each autogenerated page
- `titleContent`: The generated title for this element

- `outlineTitle`: (optional) Only used by `Chapter`
- `numberAt`: (optional) Only used by `Exercise`
- `solutionTitleContent`: (optional) Only used by `Example`
- `excludeNumberingInClassName`: (optional) Only used by `Equation`
- `hasLearningObjectives`: (optional) Only used by `Chapter Outline`
